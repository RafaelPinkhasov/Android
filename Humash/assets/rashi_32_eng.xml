      <text title="O how… remained lonely: ">Jeremiah wrote the Book of Lamentations. This is the scroll that Jehoiakim burned on the brazier that was on the fire (sic). It [originally] contained three alphabetical acrostics (Lam. ch. 1): “O how… remained,” (ch. 2) “How… brought darkness,” (ch. 4) “How dim… has become,” and he added to it, (ch. 3) “I am the man,” which contains three alphabetical acrostics, as it is said (Jer. 36:32): “and there were yet added to them many words like those,” three corresponding to three.</text>
      <text title="lonely: ">solitary, devoid of her inhabitants.</text>
      <text title="populous: ">Heb. רַבָּתִי עָם, great of people. The “yud” is superfluous, like רַבַּת עָם, for her people were many. There are many Aggadic midrashim [on this verse], but I have come to explain the language of the Scripture according to its literal meaning.</text>
      <text title="She has become like a widow: ">but not really a widow; rather, like a woman whose husband went abroad and intends to return to her.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="She weeps, yea, she weeps: ">weeping twice over the two destructions.</text>
      <text title="in the night: ">for the Temple was burned at night, as the master said (Ta’an. 29a): “At eventide, they ignited the fire upon it.” Another explanation: because of the night-the night of the weeping of the Spies on the ninth of Av caused it to happen to them (Lam. Rabbah ms. 1:178, Targum, Sanh. 104b, Ta’an. 29a). Another explanation: in the night-for whoever weeps at night, the one who hears his voice weeps along with him (Lam. Rabbah 1:24, Sanh. ad loc.).</text>
      <text title="and her tears are on her cheek: ">since she weeps constantly.</text>
      <text title="all her friends: ">those who love her.</text>

    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="Judah went into exile: ">from her land.</text>
      <text title="and great servitude: ">with which the Chaldeans burdened her.</text>
      <text title="she settled among the nations: ">and in the place where she was exiled and settled she found no rest.</text>
      <text title="between the boundaries: ">where there is a high place on either side, and there is no place to flee.</text>
      <text title="the boundaries: ">Heb. הַמְצָרִים, the boundaries of fields and vineyards. The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah 1:29) explains: between the seventeenth of Tammuz and the ninth of Av.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="because no one comes to the appointed season: ">the pilgrims who went up for the festivals.</text>
      <text title="her maidens grieve: ">Heb. נוּגוֹת, an expression of grief (יָגוֹן) , and there is no radical but the “gimmel” alone.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="5">
      <text title="are at ease: ">dwell in tranquility.</text>
      <text title="has afflicted her: ">caused her grief, and this is an expression of grief.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="like harts who did not find pasture: ">like harts who did not find pasture, who have no strength to flee, for their strength has been weakened by hunger.</text>
      <text title="pursuer: ">Heb. רוֹדֵף. Every רֹדֵף in Scripture is defective (רֹדֵף), but this one is full (רוֹדֵף) , for they were pursued with a full pursuit. Therefore the paytan composed “I was fully pursued, but the year of my redemption is missing, (גְאֻלַי).” (Isa. 63:4): “The year of my redemption (גְאֻלַי) has arrived” is spelled defectively.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="Jerusalem recalls: ">in her exile.</text>
      <text title="the days of her poverty: ">the days of her destruction, which brought her to poverty.</text>
      <text title="and her miseries: ">Heb. וּמְרוּדֶיהָ. This is an expression of pain, like (Jud. 11:37): “and I wailed (וְיָרַדְתִּי) upon the mountains” ; (Ps. 55:3): “I lament (אָרִיד) in my speech, and I moan.”</text>
      <text title="all her precious things: ">And she remembered all the good of her precious things that were from days of old.</text>
      <text title="gloating on her desolation: ">Heb. מִשְּׁבַּתֶיהָ. They rejoiced over the cessation of her festivals, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths; and the Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) interprets it as a different expression, that they rested in exile on the Sabbaths and festivals and observed the seventh year, and the heathens ridiculed them and said, “Fools! In your land you did not keep the Sabbatical Year, and now in exile you keep it? In your land, you did not keep the Sabbath, and now in exile you keep it?”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="a wanderer: ">Heb. לְנִידָה, an exile, an expression of moving and wandering (נָע וָנָד), esmo(u)vement in Old French, that which moves on.</text>
      <text title="her shame: ">Heb. עֶרְוָתָה, lit. her nakedness.</text>
      <text title="she herself sighed: ">Heb. נֶאֶנְחָה is in the passive past tense, sospirer in Old French, to sigh, [a verb]."They heard that I am sighing (נֶאֶנָחָה) (verse 21) is a noun, sospirose in Old French, one who sighs.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="Her uncleanliness is in her skirts: ">This is an expression of disgrace. Her menstrual blood is visible in the skirts of her garments, i.e., her sins are conspicuous; she committed them flagrantly.</text>
      <text title="she was not mindful of her end: ">When they would sin, they were not mindful of what their end would be. Therefore, “she fell astonishingly.” Her descent was astonishing, bringing about much bewilderment, for everyone was bewildered that this happened to her, something that did not happen to any other city.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="10">
      <text title="The adversary stretched forth his hand: ">Ammon and Moab.</text>
      <text title="upon all her precious things: ">the Siphrei Torah, which are spoken of as (Ps. 19: 11): “They are to he desired more than gold.” All turned to plunder silver and gold, and they turned upon the Siphrei Torah in order to burn them, because it is written in them, (Deut. 23:4): “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter, etc.”</text>
      <text title="whom You did command not to enter into Your assembly: ">These are Ammon and Moab.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="12">
      <text title="let it not happen to you: ">Such a calamity should no longer happen to all those who transgress the Law. Our Sages said (Sanh. 104b): It is derived from here that “kuvlana” has a basis in Scripture. See what He did to me; behold and see, etc.</text>
      <text title="which has been dealt to me: ">which has been done to me.</text>
      <text title="[with] which the Lord saddened: ">on the day of His fierce anger. This is an expression [denoting] grief, saddening.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="13">
      <text title="and it broke them: ">Heb. וַיִרְדֶנָה, equivalent to וַיִרֶד אוֹתָה, and it broke it, [referring to each of his bones] through punishment and suffering. Therefore, the “nun” is punctuated with a “dagesh,” so that it is interpreted in the feminine singular, like יַעֲשֶׂנָה, he will do it; יְכַסְמֶנָה, he will gnaw at it; יִרְעֶנָה, will graze upon it; for עֶצֶם, bone, is in the feminine gender, as Scripture states (Ezek. 36:4): הָעֲצָמוֹת הַיְבֵשׁוֹת, the dry bones.“ It broke each one. Another explanation: וַיִרְדֶנָה is like (Jud. 14:9): ” and he separated it (וַיִרְדֵהוּ) into his hands." It scrapes and separates the marrow from its midst.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="14">
      <text title="The yoke of my transgressions was marked: ">Heb. נִשְׂקַד. This word has no likeness in Scripture, and in the Aramaic language of the Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana p. 153), they call a goad מַסְקְדָא, an ox goad, and I say that it is equivalent to pointurez in Old French. My transgressions were dotted, spotted, and marked in the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, for a remembrance. Their number and their recompense were not forgotten.</text>
      <text title="they have become interwoven: ">Heb. יִשְּׂתָּרְגוּ. They became many plaits, and came up on my neck. This is the language of the Mishnah (See M.K. 1:8). We may not girth (מְסָרְגִין) the bedsteads.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="15">
      <text title="The Lord has trampled: ">Heb. סִלָה. He trampled and trod, an expression of (Isa. 62:10): “pave, pave the highway (סֹלוּ סֹלוּ הַמְסִלָה),” [meaning to beat down the road].</text>
      <text title="He summoned an assembly against me: ">Heb. מוֹעֵד, a gathering of troops to come against me. And our Sages expounded what they expounded (Pes. 77a, Ta’an. 29a, Sanh. 104b): Tammuz of that year was a full (thirty-day) month; [i.e., the Tammuz] of the second year from the Exodus from Egypt. Therefore, the return of the Spies occurred on the night of the ninth of Av, upon which their weeping was established for generations (Ta’an. ad loc., Sanh. ad loc., Sotah 35a).</text>
      <text title="the Lord has trodden as in a wine press: ">An expression of massacre, like (Isa. 63:3): “A wine press I trod alone.” As one treads grapes to extract their wine, so did He trample the women to extract their blood.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="16">
      <text title="my eye, yea, my eye: ">i.e., my eye constantly sheds tears. The double expression indicates that there was no letup.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="17">
      <text title="Zion spreads out her hands: ">Heb. פֵּרְשָּׂה. Like (Isa. 25:11): “And he shall spread out (וּפֵרַשּׂ) his hands in his midst,” like a person who moves his hands to and fro and demonstrates his pain with them. Another explanation is: Zion broke, an expression of breaking, like (Lam. 4: 4): “no one breaks it for them” ; (Jer. 16:7): “and they shall not break [bread] (יִפְרְסוּ) for them in mourning,” to console him for his dead [kinsman]. So did Menachem classify it (Machbereth Menachem p. 146). And in the language of the Mishnah (Ber. 37a), the broken piece of bread (פְּרוּסָה) is intact. And it means that Zion was in pain like a person who clasps his hands and breaks them. I found an addendum.</text>
      <text title="the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries shall be round about him: ">He commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries would surround him. Even when they were exiled to Babylon and to Assyria, Sennacherib exiled their enemies, Ammon and Moab, and settled them beside them, and they taunted them, as is stated in Tractate Kiddushin (72a): Humania was in Babylon, entirely occupied by Ammonites.</text>
      <text title="an outcast: ">Heb. לְנִדָה, for an outcast and a disgrace.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="19">
      <text title="I called to my lovers: ">Heb. לַמְאַהֲבַי, to those who make themselves appear as lovers.</text>
      <text title="[but] they deceived me: ">e.g., the children of Ishmael, who went forth toward the exiles when the captors were leading them on the road nearby, as if they were compassionate toward them. And they brought them various kinds of salty foods and inflated skin flasks. They [the Jews] thought that these were [flasks of] wine, so they ate and became thirsty and wished to drink, and when they untied the flask with their teeth, the air entered their intestines and they died. This is what Scripture says (Isa. 21:13f.): “In the forest in Arabia you shall lodge, etc. Bring water toward the thirsty! The inhabitants of the land of Tema came before the wanderer with bread.”</text>
      <text title="to revive their souls: ">so that they should revive their souls.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="20">
      <text title="burn: ">Heb. חֳמַרְמָרוּ, they became shriveled, and there is an expression like this in the language of the Mishnah (Hul. 3:3): “It fell into the fire and its intestines were scorched (וְנֶחְמְרוּ).”</text>
      <text title="in the house it is like death: ">Within the house was fear of demons and destructive beings and angels of death, and from without, the enemy’s sword was bereaving them.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="21">
      <text title="that You have done it: ">You caused them to hate me when You separated me from their food and from their drink and from intermarrying with them. Had I intermarried with them, they would have had compassion upon me and upon their daughters’ sons.</text>
      <text title="You had brought the day that You proclaimed: ">If only You had brought upon them the appointed day that You proclaimed upon me.</text>
      <text title="and let them be like me: ">in distress.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="22">
      <text title="May all their wickedness come before You: ">May all their iniquities be remembered and counted before You.</text>
      <text title="and deal with them: ">Heb. וְעוֹלֵל, and do, like (Prov. 20:11): “Also a child can disguise himself with his deeds (בְּמַעֲלָלָיו)” ; (Jer. 32:19): “and in accordance with the fruit of his deeds (מַעֲלָלָיו).”</text>

      <text title="brought darkness: ">Heb. יָעִיב, brought darkness, as Scripture states (I Kings 18:45): “the heavens grew dark with clouds (בְּעָבִים).”</text>
      <text title="from heaven to earth: ">After He lifted them up to heaven, He cast them to earth all at once, and not little by little, [as] from a lofty roof to a deep pit.</text>
      <text title="His footstool: ">that is the Temple.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="the habitations of Jacob: ">Heb. נְאוֹת, the houses of Jacob, an expression of נָוֶה, a dwelling.</text>
      <text title="He has struck [them] to the ground: ">He humbled them to the ground.</text>
      <text title="He has profaned the kingdom and its princes: ">These are the Israelites, who were called (Exod. 19: 6): “a kingdom of priests.”</text>
      <text title="and its princes: ">There is a Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah 2:5) [that states that] these are the heavenly princes [whose assignments] He changed. The one appointed over fire He appointed over water, and He changed all the appointees because there were among the wicked of Israel those who knew the Ineffable Name, and they relied [upon the fact] that they could adjure the heavenly princes to save them from fire, from water and from the sword. Now, when he would adjure the prince of fire by his name, he would reply, “This dominion is not in my hands,” and similarly, all of them.</text>

    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="He has withdrawn His right hand: ">He withdrew Himself as though withdrawing His right hand from waging war on behalf of His children.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="He has bent His bow: ">Heb. דרך lit. trod. Since this is the procedure of those who bend the bow, who are strong, to place their foot upon them when he bends them; it is therefore worded as an expression of treading.</text>
      <text title="He has poured out His fury like fire: ">The arrangement of the words is as follows: He poured out His anger, which is like fire, for we do not find pouring of fire, except in conjunction with anger, as it is written (Ps. 79:6): “Pour out Your wrath upon the nations.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="5">
      <text title="and He increased in the daughter of Judah: ">He increased in the congregation of Judah.</text>
      <text title="pain and wailing: ">Heb. תַּאֲנִיָה וַאֲנִיָה, pain and wailing.</text>
      <text title="and He increased: ">Heb. וַיֶרֶב. The “yud” is vowelized with a small “pattah” (seggol), which is an expression of increasing others. (Exod. 1:20): “and the people multiplied (וַיִרֶב) and became very strong,” is vowelized with a “hirik” , which is an expression meaning that he himself increased, and so every word whose radical ends with a “hey,” e.g. פנה, to turn, זנה to go astray, בכה, to weep, are vowelized in that manner when the “hey” is missing, when it speaks of itself [i.e., the simple (קַל) conjugation, not the causative], e.g. (Exod. 7:23): “And Pharaoh turned (וַיִפֶן).” But when he speaks of others [i.e, the causative conjugation (הפעיל)], it is vowelized with a small “pattah” (seggol), e.g. (Jud. 15:4): “and he turned (וַיֶפֶן) tail to tail” ; (II Kings 25:21): “And Judah went into exile (וַיִגֶל) from his land” ; (ibid. 18:11): “and the king of Babylon (sic) exiled (וַיֶגֶל) Israel to Assyria.”</text>

    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="He stripped: ">Heb. וַיַחְמֹס, an expression of cutting, and so (Job 15:33): “He will cast off (יַחְמֹס) like a vine” ; (Jer. 13:22): “your steps were cut off (נֶחְמְסוּ).”</text>
      <text title="like a garden: ">as they cut off the vegetables of a garden.</text>
      <text title="His Tabernacle: ">Heb. שֻׂכּוֹ, His habitation. It is written שֻׂכּוֹ [with a “sin” rather than with a “sammech”, intimating] that He assuaged (שִּׁכֵּ) His anger against His children with the destruction of His House. Thus it is interpreted in the Midrash of Lamentations (Lam. Rabbah).</text>
      <text title="and laid in ruins His Meeting Place: ">The Holy of Holies, where He would meet with His children, as it is said (Exod. 25:22): “And I will meet (וְנוֹעַדְתִּי) you there.”</text>

    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="Her gates are sunk into the ground: ">The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) states: Because they imparted honor to the Ark, as it is said (Ps. 24:9): “[You] gates, lift up your heads.” Therefore, no one had any power over them, and they sank into the ground (Lam. Rabbah). Our Sages (Sotah 9a) said that they were David’s handiwork; therefore, the enemies did not have any power over them.</text>

Rabbah) states: Nebuchadnezzar caused them to sit on the ground when Zedekiah rebelled against him and transgressed his oath. He came and stationed himself in Daphne of Antioch, and sent for the Sanhedrin, and they came toward him. He recognized that they were men of imposing appearance and sat them down in golden chairs. He said to them, “Recite your Torah for me chapter by chapter and translate it for me.” As soon as they reached the chapter dealing with vows, he said to them, “What if he wishes to retract, can he retract?” They said to him, “Let him go to a sage, and he will absolve him of it.” He said to them, “If so, you absolved Zedekiah of his oath.” He gave the order, and they pushed them off [their seats] and sat them on the ground. They then tied the hair of their heads to the tails of horses and dragged them.</text>
