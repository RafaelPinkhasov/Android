And the Lord has granted my lord the king vengeance this day of Saul and of his seed."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite and said to them, "As the Lord lives, Who delivered my person from every distress.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">That he who told me saying, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' and he was in his own eyes as a herald of good tidings, I took hold of him and slew him in Ziglag, who [had expected] me to give him a reward for good tidings.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">'How much more when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house on his bed. And now, shall I not hold you accountable for his blood, and remove you from the earth?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And David commanded the young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But the head of Ish-bosheth they took and buried in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">And all the tribes of Israel came to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying: "Here we are.

And all the king's sons arose, and they rode off, each one on his mule, and they fled.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And it came to pass, while they were on their way, that the news came to David, saying: "Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and not one of them is left."</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And the king arose, and tore his clothes, and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood with their clothes torn.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimah, answered and said, "Let not my lord say that they have killed all the young men, the king's sons; for Amnon alone is dead; for by the mouth of Absalom this had been arranged from the day he forced Tamar his sister.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And now, let not my lord the king put to his heart the thing to say that all the king's sons are dead; but only Amnon is dead."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And Absalom fled. And the young man that kept watch raised his eyes and looked, and behold a large crowd was coming from the way behind him, by the hillside.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And Jonadab said to the king, "Behold the king's sons have come, as your servant said, so it was."</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And it was as soon as he had finished speaking that, behold, the king's sons came and raised up their voices and cried, and also the king and all his servants wept profusely.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Absalom fled and he went to Talmai, the son of Amihud, the king of Geshur. And he mourned for his son all the days.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Absalom fled, and he went to Geshur, and he was there three years.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And [the soul of] King David longed to go forth to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, being that he was dead.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="14"><pasuk id="1">And Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart (longed) for Absalom.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Joab sent to Tekoa and took from there a wise woman; and he said to her: "Please pretend to be a mourner, and please put on mourning clothes, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned many days for the dead.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And come to the king and speak to him in this manner." And Joab put the words into her mouth.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, and fell to the ground, and prostrated herself; and she said: 'Save, O' king'.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the king said to her: 'What ails you?' And she said: 'Truly I am a woman [who is] a widow, and my husband is dead.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And your handmaid had two sons, and they both fought in the field, and there was no rescuer between them, and one struck the other and killed him.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And, behold, the whole family rose against your handmaid, and said: "Deliver the one that struck his brother whom he slew, and so destroy also the heir; and so they shall quench my coal which is left, so as not to leave my husband a name or a remainder upon the face of the earth."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders about you."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, "On me, my lord, the king, be the iniquity, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the king said, "Who ever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he shall no longer continue to touch you."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And she said, "I beg you, let the king remember the Lord your God that the avenger of blood destroy not excessively so that they destroy not my son." And he said, "As the Lord lives, if one hair of your son shall fall to the earth."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the woman said, "May your handmaid speak a word with my lord the king?" And he said, "Speak."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the woman said, "Why have you thought such a thing about the people of God? [now, consider not] that the king in speaking this word has done so accidentally, so that the king shall not bring back his banished one.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">For die we must, and [are] as water that is spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again; and God favors not a soul, but He devises means that he that is banished be not cast from Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And now my motive for having come to speak of this thing to the king my lord [is] because the people have made me afraid; and your maidservant said: I will now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">For the king will hear, to deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man [that would] destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And your handmaid said, 'Let, I pray, the word of my lord the king be for comfort, for as an angel of God so is my lord the king, to discern the good and the bad; and the Lord your God may be with you'."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the king answered and he said to the woman, "I beg you not to hide from me anything that I shall ask you." And the woman said: "Let my lord the king please speak."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the king said: "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" And the woman answered and said, "As your soul lives, my lord the king, if anyone can turn to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken, for your servant Joab he bade me, and he put in the mouth of your handmaid all these words.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">In order to bring about the face of the matter, has your servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God to know all that is in the earth."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the king said to Joab: "Behold now, you have done this thing, now go bring back the young man Absalom."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Joab fell on his face to the ground and he prostrated himself, and he blessed the king; and Joab said: "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, O' king, in that the king has done the request of your servant."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Joab arose and went to Geshur, and he brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the king said: "Let him turn to his house, but my face let him not see." And Absalom turned to his house, and the king's face he saw not.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Now like Absalom there was not a man in all Israel as beautiful, to be as [totally] praiseworthy [for beauty]; from the sole of his feet to the crown of his head, there was no blemish in him.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And when he shaved his head-and it was at every year's end that he shaved it; because the hair was heavy on him, then he would shave it- he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And to Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar; and she was a woman of beautiful appearance.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem two full years; and the king's face he did not see.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Absalom sent to Joab, to send him to the king; and he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, and he would not come.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And he said to his servants, "See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And Joab arose, and he came to Absalom to his house, and he said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Absalom said to Joab, "Behold, I have sent to you, saying: 'Come here,' that I may send you to the king to say: 'Why have I come from Geshur?' it would be better for me were I still there; and now I will see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And Joab came to the king, and he told him: and he called for Absalom, and he came to the king, and he prostrated himself to him on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="15"><pasuk id="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom made for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men were running before him.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Absalom would rise up, and stand beside the path of the gate; and it was [when] any man that would have a suit [due] to come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him and he said: "From what city are you?" and he said: "Of one of the tribes of Israel is your servant.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Absalom said to him: "See your words are good and right; but there is none of the king's [judges] to hear you."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Absalom said, "Oh, who will appoint me judge in the land, and every man who has a quarrel or suit, will come to me, then I will [surely] do him justice."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And it would be, when a man came near to prostrate himself before him, that he put forth his hand and took hold of him, and kissed him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Absalom did likewise to all the Israelites that came to the king for judgment. And Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it came to pass at the end of forty years; and Absalom said to the king; "Allow me to go, I beg you, and pay my vow which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">For your servant vowed a vow during my stay in Geshur in Aram, saying: 'If the Lord shall bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord'."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the king said to him: "Go in peace." And he arose and went to Hebron.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the shofar, then you shall say: 'Absalom is king in Hebron'."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And with Absalom went two hundred men [that were] invited; and went in their innocence; and did not know of anything.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, as he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, and the people with Absalom were steadily increasing.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the messenger came to David saying, "The hearts of the people of Israel are after Absalom."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And David said to all his servants that were with him in Jerusalem: "Arise and let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly lest he hurry and overtake us, and bring upon us evil, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the king's servants said to the king, "Whatever my lord the king shall choose, behold your servants [are ready to do]."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the king went forth, and all his household were right behind him. And the king led the ten women (who were) concubines to keep the house.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the king went forth, and all the people were right behind him: and they remained standing at the farthest house.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And all his servants passed on beside him, and all the archers and all the slingers, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the king said to Ittai the Gittite; 'Why do you also go with us? return, and abide with the king; for you are a foreigner, and if you are wont to wander, [go to] your own place.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">[Only] yesterday you came, and today I should move you about with us, seeing that I go wherever I can go? Return and take back your brothers with you, (and do) kindness and truth (to them)."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Ittai answered the king and said, 'As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, that in the place where my lord the king shall be, whether for life or for death, for there shall your servant be.'</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." And Ittai the Gittite passed over and [so did] all his men and all the little ones that were with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And all the land wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over; and the king passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And lo, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up, until all the people had finished passing out of the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And the king said to Zadok, "Carry back the ark of God to the city; if I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, then He will bring me back, and He will show me it, and His habitation.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">But if so [He] says, 'I do not want you,' behold, here I am, let Him do to me as seems good in His eyes."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And the king said to Zadok the priest: 'Do you (not) see? return to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons, [shall be] with you.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">See, I will tarry in the plains of the wilderness, until there comes word from you to announce to me.'</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem, and they abode there.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And David went up by the ascent of the [mount of] olives, weeping as he went up. And he had his head covered and he went barefoot; and (of) all the people that were with him every man covered his head, weeping as they went up.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And [someone] told David saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David said, "Make foolish, I beg you, the counsel of Ahithophel, O' Lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And David was coming to the top where he would prostrate himself to God, and behold, towards him [came] Hushai the Archite with his shirt torn, and earth upon his head.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And David said to him, "If you pass on with me you will be a burden to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">But if you return to the city and you say to Absalom, 'I O' king will be your servant, just as I was previously your father's servant,' and now I am your servant; then you will (be able) to frustrate for me the counsel of Ahithophel.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priest? And it shall [therefore] be that everything you hear from the king's house, you shall tell to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And, behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz to Zadok, and Jonathan to Abiathar, and through them you shall send to me everything you hear."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Hushai the Archite, the friend of David, came into the city, and Absalom [was] coming to Jerusalem.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="16"><pasuk id="1">And David was a little past the top (of the mount), and behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth (came) toward him, with a pair of saddled asses, and upon them (were) two hundred (loaves) of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred summer fruit, and a flask of wine.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the king said to Ziba, "What for are these to you?" And Ziba said, 'the asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and the summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine for the faint to drink in the wilderness'.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" And Ziba said to the king, "Behold he lives in Jerusalem, for he said, "Today the house of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours." And Ziba said, "I prostrate myself; let me find favor in your eyes, my lord O' king."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And king David came to Bahurim and, behold, there came out of there a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, coming forth and cursing.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he threw stones at David, and at all king David's servants and at all the people and at all the mighty men who were on his right and on his left hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And so said Shimei in his curse, "Begone, begone, you man of blood, and you wicked man.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The Lord has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hands of Absalom your son; and behold you are in your own evil for you are a man of blood."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I beg you, and remove his head."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the king said, "What is it between me and you, sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the Lord has [surely] said to him, 'Curse David'; who then shall [have the right to] say, 'Why have you done so'?"</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold my son who came from my body seeks my life; how much more now [that] the Benjamite [should do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord has bidden him.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Perhaps the Lord will see (the tears of) my eye, and the Lord will return to me good instead of his curse on this day."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And David and his men went by the road; and Shimei went along the hillside opposite him, going and cursing and he threw stones toward him, and he threw earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the king, and all the people that were with him were weary, and he refreshed himself there.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel [was] with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And it came to pass when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, "[long] live the king, [long] live the king."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your kindness to your friend? why did you not go with your friend?"</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Hushai said to Absalom, "No, but to whom the Lord and these people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, to him will I be, and with him will I abide.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Secondly, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give yourself counsel what we shall do."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Come in to your father's concubines that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father; then the hands of all that are with you will be strengthened."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they spread for Absalom a tent upon the roof; and Absalom came to his father's concubines before the eyes of all Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days was as if a man inquired of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both to David and to Absalom.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="17"><pasuk id="1">And Ahithophel said to Absalom: "Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will rise and pursue David tonight.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and I will startle him: and all the people that are with him will flee, and I will smite the king alone.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And I will bring back all the people to you; when all shall have returned, the man whom you seek then all the people will be at peace."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the thing seemed right to the eyes of Absalom, and to all the elders of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Absalom said, "Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he too has to say."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Hushai came to Absalom; and Absalom spoke to him saying, "In this manner has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do his bidding? If not, then you speak."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Hushai said to Absalom, "The counsel which Ahithophel has counseled this time is not good."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Hushai [continued] saying, "You know your father and his men that they are mighty men, and they are of embittered spirit, as a bear in the field, bereft of cubs, and your father is a man of war, and he will not lodge with the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Behold, now he is [surely] hidden in one of the pits or one of the places; and it will come to pass, if there fall among them at the first, then someone will hear it and say, 'There has been a massacre among the people that are behind Absalom.'</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And even if he be valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and valiant men are they that are with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Therefore I counsel, that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba as many as the sand that is by the sea; and you personally go to battle.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And we shall come upon him in some place where he is found, and we shall light upon him, as the dew falls on the ground; and there shall not be left of him, and of all the men that are with him, even one.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And if he withdraws himself into a city, then all of Israel shall bring up ropes to that city and we will drag it to the valley until there shall not be found there even one small stone."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "the counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel,"-for the Lord had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel in order that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "In thus and thus manner did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And now, send quickly, and tell David saying: "Do not lodge the night in the plains of the wilderness, but pass [speedily] over, lest the king be destroyed, and all the people that are with him."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Jonathan and Ahimaaz were standing by En-rogel; and the maidservant went and she told them that they should go notify King David; for they were not to be seen coming into the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">But a lad spotted them, and told Absalom; and they both went speedily away to the house of a man in Bahurim, and he had a well in his courtyard; and they lowered themselves there.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the woman took and spread the covering over the mouth of the well and she spread groats upon it, and nothing was known.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Absalom's servants came to the woman in the house, and they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman said to them, "They have forded the river." And they sought but could not find [them]; and they returned to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And it came to pass after their departure, that they came up out of the well, and they went and they told King David, "Arise and cross the water quickly, for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By the morning light not one of them was missing that had not crossed the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not done, and he saddled his ass, and he arose, and he went to his house, to his city, and he gave charge to his household and he strangled himself, and he died, and was buried in the sephulcre of his father.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And David had come to Mahanaim, and Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Amasa, had Absalom set in place of Joab over the host; and Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who came to Abigail the daughter of Nahash the sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And it came to pass, when David came to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the children of Ammon and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Beds and bowls, and earthen vessels, and wheat and barley and flour and parched grain; and beans, and lentils and parched grain.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine they presented to David and to the people that were with him, to eat, for they said, "The people are hungry, faint, and thirsty from the wilderness."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="18"><pasuk id="1">And David numbered the people that were with him, and he placed over them captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And David sent forth the people, a third in the hands of Joab, a third in the hands of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third under the hands of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, "I, too, will go forth with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the people said, "You shall not go forth; for if we flee they will not pay attention to us; [now] even if half of us should die, they [still] will not pay attention to us, for now you are [equal to] ten thousand of us; and therefore now it is better that you be for us from the city as aid."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the king said to them: "What seems best to you, I will do." And the king stood by the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai saying: "Deal gently for me with the youth, with Absalom." And all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains regarding Absalom.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the people of Israel were beaten there before the servants of David, and the slaughter there, on that day, was very great, twenty thousand men.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the battle spread from there over the face of all the land; and the forest devoured more of the people, than the sword devoured on that day.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Absalom chanced to come before the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of the great terebinth, and his head caught hold in the terebinth, and he was placed between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was beneath him passed on.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And a man saw it and told Joab. And he said, "Behold I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Joab said to the man who told him, "Now if you had seen it, then why did you not smite him there to the ground? And it would have been [incumbent] upon me to give you ten [pieces of] silver, and a belt."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the man said to Joab: "Though I should weigh on my palms a thousand [pieces] of silver, I would not stretch out my hand against the king's son, because before our ears did the king charge you and Abishai and Ittai saying, 'Take care whoever [it may be] of the youth, of Absalom.'</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Even if I would deal falsely with myself, now nothing can be hidden from the king, and you [yourself] would stand from afar."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Joab said, "I shall no longer request of you." And he took three darts in his hand and thrust them into Absalom's heart while he was yet alive in the heart of the terebinth.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And there circled about ten young men who were Joab's armor bearers, and they struck Absalom, and killed him.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Joab blew with a shofar, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they took Absalom, and they cast him in the forest, into the great pit, and they placed over him a very large heap of stones; and all of Israel fled each to his tents.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Absalom had taken and established for himself in his lifetime, the monument which is in the king's valley for he said, "I have no son in order to cause (people) to remember my name;" and he called the monument after his own name, and they called it Yad Absalom until this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok said, "Let me now run and bring news to the king that the Lord has avenged him from the hand of his enemies."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Joab said to him: "You are not the man to bring news this day, but you shall [perhaps] bring news another day, but this day you shall not bring news, because the king's son is dead."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Joab said to the Cushite "Go tell the king what you have seen." And the Cushite bowed down to Joab, and ran.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok continued again, and said to Joab, "Come what may, please allow me to run after the Cushite." And Joab said, "Why should you [desire] to run, my son, since for you there is no [reward] given for the news!"</pasuk><pasuk id="23">"But, come what may," [he said], "I will run." And he said to him, "Run" And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and he went ahead of the Cushite.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold [there was] a man running alone.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And the watchman called out, and told the king.
