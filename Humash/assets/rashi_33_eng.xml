      <text title="The words of Koheleth: ">Wherever it says, “the words of,” it refers to words of reproof. (Deut. 1:1): “These are the words that Moses spoke” … (ibid. 32:15): “And Jeshurun became fat.” (Amos 1:1): “The words of Amos” … (ibid. 4:1): “Hearken to this word, O cows of Bashan.” (Jer. 1:1): “The words of Jeremiah” … (ibid. 30: 6): “Ask now and see whether a male gives birth, etc.” (II Sam. 23: 1): “And these are the words of David” … (verse 6): “But the wicked are all as thorns thrust away.” “The words of Koheleth… The sun rises… All the rivers run into the sea.” He refers to the wicked as the sun, the moon, and the sea, which have no reward. So it was taught in Sifrei (Deut. 1:1). I learned from there that the section deals with the wicked and compares them to the rising of the sun, which ultimately sets. Addendum: Another explanation: All the rivers run into the sea. What is the meaning of this? This is stated concerning idolaters, the fools who prostrate themselves to the water and think that it has substance since they see the Great Sea, into which all the rivers run, and it is not full, but they do not know that to the place where the rivers flow, they repeatedly go, for the water of the rivers that flow into the sea is the very same water that already flowed. They flow from under the deep and go above the ground until the sea and repeatedly flow. Therefore, the rivers do not stop, and the sea does not become full, and not because they have substance. End of addendum.</text>
      <text title="Koheleth: ">Because he gathered (קִהֵל) many wisdoms, and similarly, elsewhere (Prov. 30:1) Scripture calls him Agur the son of Jakeh, because he gathered (אָגַר) all the wisdom and vomited it (וְהִקִיאָה), and some say that he would say all his words in an assembly (בְּהַקְהֵל).</text>
      <text title="king in Jerusalem: ">the city of wisdom.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="Vanity of vanities, said Koheleth: ">Koheleth complains about the creation of the seven days of Creation, that all is vanity of vanities.</text>
      <text title="Vanity of: ">Heb. הֲבֵל is punctuated with a hataph pattah because it is in the construct state; i.e., the vanity of the vanities. Seven vanities [are mentioned], corresponding to the seven days of Creation.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="What profit: ">reward and remainder.</text>
      <text title="under the sun: ">in lieu of the Torah, which is called light, as it is stated (Prov. 6:23): “and the Torah is light.” All the toil which he does instead of engaging in the Torah-what reward is there in it?</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="A generation goes and a generation comes: ">As much as the wicked man toils and labors to oppress and to rob, he does not outlive his works, for the generation goes and another generation comes and takes all away from his sons, as it is stated (Job 20:10): “His sons will placate the poor.”</text>
      <text title="but the earth endures forever: ">But who are the ones who endure? The humble and low, who bring themselves down to the earth, as it is stated (Ps. 37:11): “But the humble shall inherit the earth.” And Midrash Tanhuma states: All the righteous of Israel are called earth [or land], as it is said (Mal. 3:12): “for you shall be a desirable land.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="5">
      <text title="The sun rises, etc.: ">A generation goes and a generation comes as the sun rises at dawn and sets at eventide, and it goes throughout the night, yearning to rise from the place whence it rose yesterday, that it will rise from there also today.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="the will: ">Heb. הָרוּחַ, the will of the sun, talant in Old French, like (Ezek. 1: 12): “wherever would be the will (הָרוּחַ) to go.”</text>
      <text title="returns to its circuits: ">Also on the morrow, the entire circuit and encircling that it encircled yesterday, it encircles and goes around today.</text>
      <text title="it goes to the south: ">forever in the day.</text>
      <text title="and goes around to the north: ">forever in the night.</text>
      <text title="goes around and around: ">to the eastern and western sides, which it sometimes goes through by day, and sometimes goes around at night. In Tammuz it goes through them, and in Teveth it goes around them. Also the wicked, no matter how much their sun rises, they will ultimately set. No matter how much they gain power, they will ultimately return to the place of filth. From the place of filth they came, and to the place of filth they will go. And so…</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="All the rivers flow into the sea: ">because they do not remain therein, for the ocean is higher than the entire world, as it is said (Amos 5:8): “He calls the water of the sea and pours it, etc.” Now from where does a person pour? From above downward, and the rivers flow in the tunnels under the mountains from the ocean and repeatedly flow, and this is the meaning of: “to the place where the rivers flow, there they repeatedly go.” Also, the wicked man, (below 5:15) “just as it came, so shall it go.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="All things are wearisome… the eye shall not be sated from seeing, nor shall the ear be filled: ">This refers back to, “What profit [has man]” if he exchanges the study of Torah to speak wasteful words? They are only wearisome, and he will not be able to acquire them all, and if he comes to engage in the vision of the eye, it will not be satisfied, and if in the hearing of the ear, it will not be filled.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="What has been is what will be, etc.: ">In whatever he learns, in a matter that is an exchange for the sun, there is nothing new. He will see only that which already was, which was created in the six days of Creation. But one who meditates on the Torah constantly finds new insights therein, as it is stated (Prov. 5:19): “her breasts will satisfy you at all times.” Just as this breast, whenever the infant feels it, he finds a taste in it, so are the words of Torah (Er. 54b), and so we find in Tractate Hagigah, that Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus said things that the ear had never heard, concerning the account of the Celestial Chariot.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="10">
      <text title="There is a thing: ">that comes to your hand under the sun about which the speaker will say, “See, this is a new thing!” But it is not new, for it has already been so for ages that have passed before us, but “there is no remembrance of former [generations].” Therefore, it seems to be new.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="11">
      <text title="neither will the later ones that will be: ">after us have any remembrance in the generations that will be after them. And the Midrash Aggadah interprets this as referring to the obliteration of the remembrance of Amalek, for his remembrance will ultimately be obliterated, as it is said (Obadiah 1:18): “and the house of Esau will have no survivors.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="12">
      <text title="I am Koheleth; I was king: ">over the whole world, and later, over Israel, and then, over Jerusalem alone, and finally, [only] over my staff, for it says: “I was king in Jerusalem,” but now, I am no longer king.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="13">
      <text title="And I applied my heart to inquire: ">in the Torah, which is wisdom, and to ponder over it concerning all the evil deeds mentioned above, which are committed under the sun, and I pondered that it is a sore task that the Holy One, blessed be He, set before the children of men. (Deut. 30:15): “life and good, and also death and evil.”</text>
      <text title="a sore task: ">Heb. עִנְיַן רַע. They have evil behavior.</text>
      <text title="with which to occupy themselves: ">Heb. לַעֲנוֹת בּוֹ, to behave with it. עִנְיַן may be interpreted as an expression of an abode (מָעוֹן) and a dwelling, and it may also be interpreted as an expression of study (עִיוּן) and thought, and the same is true of בּו ֹלַעֲנוֹת.</text>
      <text title="has given: ">has placed before them.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="14">
      <text title="and frustration: ">Heb. וּרְעוּת רוּח, the breaking of the will, like (Isa. 8:9): “Shatter (רֹעוּ), O peoples, and be broken.” רוּחַ is synonymous with talant in Old French, will. The end of the deed is that he comes to heartache.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="15">
      <text title="What is crooked: ">during his lifetime, will not be able to be straightened after he dies. Whoever toiled on the eve of the Sabbath will eat on the Sabbath, and our Sages explained this as referring to one who was intimate with a woman forbidden to him and begot a mamzer, or to a Torah scholar who parted with the Torah, who was originally straight and became crooked.</text>
      <text title="and what is missing will not be able to be counted: ">One who excluded himself from the number of the righteous will not be able to be counted with them in their reception of reward.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="16">
      <text title="I spoke to myself: ">Now that I have sunk from my greatness, I set my heart, saying, “Who would have said about me that I would come to such a state?”</text>
      <title>Look, I have acquired great wisdom, etc.: </title>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="17">
      <text title="And I applied: ">my heart now to know the nature of wisdom, what its end is, and the nature of madness and folly.</text>
      <text title="madness: ">Heb. הֹלֵלוֹת, dullness and confusion of thoughts, an expression of mixing, like (Isa. 1:22): “diluted (מָהוּל) with water.”</text>
      <text title="and folly: ">foolishness.</text>
      <text title="I know: ">now that also wisdom has frustration in it, for in great wisdom, a person relies on his great wisdom and does not distance himself from prohibition, and much vexation comes to the Holy One, blessed be He. I said, “I will acquire many horses, but I will not return the people to Egypt,” but ultimately, I returned [them]. I said, “I will take many wives, but they will not turn my heart away,” but it is written about me, (I Kings 11:4): “his wives turned away his heart.” And so he says, (Prov. 30:1): “The words of the man concerning, ‘God is with me’; yea, God is with me, and I will be able.”</text>
    </pasuk>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="2">
    <pasuk id="1">
      <text title="I said to myself: ">since that is so, I will refrain from wisdom, and I will constantly engage in drinking.</text>
      <text title="I will mix: ">Heb. אֲנַסְכָה, an expression of mixing wine to drink, like (Prov. 9:2): “she has mingled (מָסְכָה) her wine,” the mingling of wine with water to improve it or the mingling of spices with wine for conditum (spiced wine).</text>
      <text title="and experience pleasure: ">Heb. וּרְאֵה, like בְּטוֹב וּרְאוֹת.</text>
      <text title="and behold, this too was vanity: ">For I saw through prophecy that many misfortunes come about through laughter. Belshazzar died through a banquet, and the people of the Generation of the Flood were inundated because of the abundant goodness that You lavished upon them.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="Of laughter, I said, “[It is] mingled”: ">mixed with weeping and sighs.</text>
      <text title="and concerning joy, what: ">good does it accomplish? Behold, its end is grief.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="I searched in my heart: ">I returned to search in my heart to maintain all of them: feasting, wisdom, and folly, and to indulge and to pamper my body with wine feasting. Every feast of enjoyment is called מִשְּׁתֶּה because of the wine.</text>
      <text title="conducting itself with wisdom: ">Even if my body is being indulged with wine, my heart is being conducted with wisdom, to hold onto the Torah.</text>
      <text title="and holding onto folly: ">to things that appear to me as folly, concerning which I said, (Prov. 30:1): “God is with me; yea, God is with me, and I will be able,” for example, the wearing of shaatnez and mingled species in a vineyard, which Satan and the nations of the world dispute, and so he says (below 7: 18): “It is good that you should take hold of this,” and also, concerning Saul, to whom it appeared folly to slay both man and woman, both infant and suckling, but it was the commandment of the Omnipresent, and he called it folly.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="I made myself great works: ">in the days of my greatness.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="5">
      <text title="all sorts of fruit trees: ">for Solomon recognized with his wisdom the veins of the earth: which vein leads to Cush, and there he planted peppers; which one goes to a land of carob fruits, and there he planted carob trees. For all the veins of the lands come to Zion, from where the world was founded, as it is said (Ps. 50:2): “From Zion, the all-inclusive beauty.” Therefore, it is said: “all sorts of fruit trees.” Midrash Tanhuma (Kedoshim 10).</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="pools of water: ">Like a sort of vivaria for fish, which they dig in the ground.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="and the treasures of the kings: ">the treasures of the kings-gold, silver and precious stones, which the kings collect in their treasure houses.</text>
      <text title="and the provinces: ">the treasure of all merchants.</text>
      <text title="various types of musical instruments: ">Heb. שָּׁרִים וְשָּׁרוֹת, various types of musical instruments.</text>
      <text title="wagons and coaches: ">Heb. שִּׁדָה וְשִּׁדוֹת beautiful coaches, covered wagons, and in the Gemara, [we find] a coach (שִּׁדָה) , a chest, and a closet.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="also my wisdom remained with me: ">Also, I did not forsake my wisdom because of all these affairs, and it remained with me; I did not forget it. Another explanation: It stood by me to aid me against all these.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="10">
      <text title="I did not deprive: ">I did not distance them to separate from them, and so (Num. 11: 25): “and He held back (וַיָאצֶל) some of the spirit… and placed [it] on… the elders,” like a candelabrum from which many candles are kindled, and its light is not at all diminished.</text>
      <text title="and this was my portion: ">And after doing all these, I have nothing [left] of all of them but this. Rav and Shmuel [differ]: One says, his staff, and one says, his cup. קִידוֹ is an earthenware cup, from which [people] drink (Gittin 68b). Others in the Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Zuta 2:8) interpret the entire section as referring to study halls, students, and synagogues [as follows]:</text>
      <text title="[6] a forest sprouting with trees: ">the ignorant people, for the work of fields and vineyards.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="11">
      <text title="Then I turned: ">now in all my deeds, and I see that there is no profit in them, for from all of them I am lacking.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="12">
      <text title="And I turned to see wisdom: ">I turn from all my affairs to ponder over the Torah and madness and folly, [meaning] the punishment for transgressions.</text>
      <text title="for what is the man who will come after the king: ">to supplicate him concerning a decree that they decreed upon him, and they already executed the decree. It is better for him to ponder at first upon his deeds, and he will find it unnecessary to beg.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="13">
      <text title="over folly: ">That is wickedness.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="14">
      <text title="The wise man has eyes in its beginning: ">In the beginning of the matter, he observes what will be at its end.</text>
      <text title="and I too know: ">Also, I, who praise the wise man over the fool, know that they both will die.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="15">
      <text title="And I said to myself, etc.: ">i.e., since they will both die, perhaps I will think in my heart from now on that as it happens to the wicked man, so will it happen to me. So why should I be more righteous?</text>
      <text title="And I said to myself: ">that if I think so, that is vanity, for the remembrances of the wise man and the fool are not equal. After their deaths, both of them will not be remembered together, for this one will be remembered for good, and this one will be remembered for evil.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="16">
      <text title="for seeing that in the coming days all is forgotten: ">Because I see the wicked who already lived, and who were very successful, and in the days that came after them, all their heroism and their success were forgotten.</text>
      <text title="And how shall the wise die with the fool: ">I see the righteous prospering in their deaths and availing their children, for example (Lev. 26:42): “And I shall remember My covenant with Jacob, etc.” ; (Jer. 2:2): “I remember for you the love of your youth.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="17">
      <text title="So I hated the living: ">for he was prophesying about the generation of Rehoboam, who were wicked.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="19">
      <text title="This too is vanity: ">This too is one of the vanities that were created in the world, that the wise man toils, and the fool inherits him.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="20">
      <text title="And I turned about to cause my heart to despair: ">not to toil and labor.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="21">
      <text title="For there is a man: ">Its apparent interpretation is according to its simple meaning, but the Midrash Aggadah in Tanhuma (Buber, vol. 1, p. 24) interprets it as an expression referring to the Holy One, blessed be He, concerning Whom it is said (Ezek. 1:26): “and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness like the appearance of a man.”</text>
      <text title="whose toil is with wisdom: ">as it is said (Prov. 3:19f): “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom… With His knowledge the depths were split,” and to the creatures who did not toil in it, He gave a share in it.</text>
      <text title="this too is vanity and a great evil: ">And they became a generation of vanity and the evil of man became great on the earth in the Generation of the Flood.</text>

    <pasuk id="22">
      <text title="For what has, etc.: ">For what profit has a man in all his toil and the breaking of his heart with toil and worry, which he toils, and leaves for others.</text>

      <text title="his occupation: ">Heb. עִנְיָנוֹ, his custom.</text>

    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="24">
      <text title="Is it not good for a man: ">This is a question. [Is it not good for a man] that he eat and drink and show himself enjoyment? That is, let him pay heed to performing justice and righteousness with the eating and the drinking, and so it was said to Jehoiakim (Jer. 22:15): “Your father-did he not eat and drink and perform justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="25">
      <text title="For who will eat, etc.: ">Why shall I not rejoice with my portion in eating and drinking? Who is fit to eat what I toiled for, and who will hasten to swallow it, except me?</text>

      <text title="but to the sinner He has given an occupation: ">a habit and a concern to gather and to accumulate, and to give to him who is good in God’s sight, as it is stated (Esther 8:2): “and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of the house of Haman.”</text>
      <text title="this too: ">is one of the vanities that were given to the creatures, that they toil, and someone else takes [the fruits].</text>

Therefore, he says that He made everything beautiful in its time. The fact that there is a time for death is a beautiful thing, for a person relies and says, “Perhaps the time of my death is far off,” and he builds a house and plants a vineyard, and it is [therefore] beautiful that it is concealed from people.</text>

The ocean broke through its boundary in the generation of Enosh and inundated a third of the world, and God did this so that they would fear Him. For seven days, the course of the sun was changed in the Generation of the Flood, to rise in the west and set in the east, in order that they fear Him. The sun went back ten steps in the days of Hezekiah, and in the days of Ahaz his father, the day was shortened and the night was lengthened on the day of his death, so that he should not be eulogized.

Therefore, Scripture praises him (I Sam. 1:3): “And that man was wont to go up from his city, etc.” I believe [lit., I say] that this Midrash is [based on] the end of the verse: “for God is testimony of the joy of his heart.” This is Elkanah, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, established in the Scriptures, and testified about him: “And that man was wont to go up from his city.”</text>

      <text title="A [good] name is better than good oil: ">A good name is better for a person than good oil, and on the day of death the name is better than on the day of his birth. For this reason, a good name is compared to good oil more than to other liquids, for oil-you put water into it, and it floats and rises, and is recognizable, but other liquids-you put water into them, and they absorb it.</text>
      <text title="A [good] name is better than good oil: ">Good oil runs down, as it is said: (Ps. 133:2): “As the good oil on the head runs down upon the beard.” A good name, however, goes up, as it is said: (Gen. 12: 2): “and I will make your name great.” Good oil is temporary, but a good name is eternal, as it is said: (Ps. 72:17): “May his name be forever.” Good oil flows from the flask to the palace, and no more, but a good name goes to the end of the world. Said Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon: We find that those who had good oil entered the place of life and emerged burnt up. These are Nadab and Abihu, who were anointed with the anointing oil. And we find those who possessed a good name, who entered a place of death and emerged alive, viz. Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who emerged from the fiery furnace.</text>

      <text title="for that is the end of every man: ">Since mourning marks the end of every man, every man will ultimately come to this. Therefore, the living should put his heart [to the fact] that whatever loving-kindness I bestow upon the dead, I will require that they bestow the same to me upon my death. He who raises his voice in lamentation-they will raise their voices in lamentation for him; he who bears the dead-they will bear him; he who eulogizes-they will eulogize him; he who escorts [the dead]-they will escort him (Ecc. Rabbah, Keth. 72a). Another explanation:</text>
      <text title="for that is the end of every man:: ">For that is the end of the whole man; for death is the end of all man’s days, and if now he does not bestow kindness upon him, he will no longer bestow it upon him, but if he invited him to a house of feasting and he did not go, he can say to him, “A son will ultimately be born to you, and there I will be with you. The joy of your children’s wedding will come to you, and there I will go.”</text>

Do not read וְיִשְׁתַּכְּחוּ, and they will be forgotten, but וְיִשְׁתַּבְּחוּ, and they will boast. So did our Rabbis of blessed memory expound it (Gittin 56b). Concerning the forgetting, [i.e., the legitimate wording of the verse], it is expounded as follows in the Aggadah (unknown): and ultimately, their name and their remembrance will be forgotten from that very city, that they did so therein, as it is said (Joel 4:2): “I will gather all the nations and I will take them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.” In the place where they angered Him, He will mete out retribution upon them, and so Scripture states (Ps. 73:20): “O Lord, in the city You will despise their form.”</text>

Do not wonder about the “vav” of וַחֲיָלִים, for many “vavin” appear like that in Hebrew, like (Ps. 50:18): “If you saw a thief, you agreed (וַתִּרֶץ) with him” ; (Exod. 15:2): “The strength and the cutting of the Lord was (וַיְהִי) to me a salvation,” and many are explained in this manner.</text>

Neither is this one revealed to you nor is that one revealed to you. Sometimes you think to perceive in the clouds that the wind will come, and it does not come here, but it passes and goes away to another land. This expression is like (Gen. 13: 10): “like the garden of the Lord, so the land of Egypt” ; (Isa. 24: 2): “as with the maidservant, so with her mistress; as with the buyer so with the seller.” Sometimes Scripture compares the former to the latter, and sometimes it compares the latter to the former. Here too, it teaches the knowledge of the wind from the knowledge of the womb, i.e., you should not await the wind by looking at the clouds. (GLOSS: This matter is transposed in Rashi’s words, and it is in the opposite order. We must therefore emend it as it is in exact editions, and then it will better understood, and this is the authentic version:</text>
      <text title="As you do not know: ">This is a transposed verse, explained from the end to the beginning: Just as you cannot identify the things enclosed in the full womb, that is, the things closed in and confined in the full womb, and even though it protrudes outward, you do not know what is in her womb, so do you not know the way of the wind, i.e., the knowledge of both these things is equal [from the book Sifthei Hachamim].)</text>

We find in the case of Rabbi Akiva that he had twenty-four thousand disciples from Gabbath to Antipatris, and they all died between Passover and Shavuoth, and he came to our Sages in the south and taught them. And concerning children, we find in the case of Ibzan, (Jud. 12:9): “and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in for his sons,” and they all died in his lifetime (Baba Bathra 91a), but in his old age, he begot Obed, who survived him.</text>
