<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt; with Jacob, each man and his household came:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Now all those descended from Jacob were seventy souls, and Joseph, [who] was in Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Now Joseph died, as well as all his brothers and all that generation.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">The children of Israel were fruitful and swarmed and increased and became very very strong, and the land became filled with them.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">A new king arose over Egypt, who did not know about Joseph.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we are.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Get ready, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they increase, and a war befall us, and they join our enemies and depart from the land."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">So they appointed over them tax collectors to afflict them with their burdens, and they built store cities for Pharaoh, namely Pithom and Raamses.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But as much as they would afflict them, so did they multiply and so did they gain strength, and they were disgusted because of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">So the Egyptians enslaved the children of Israel with back breaking labor.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And they embittered their lives with hard labor, with clay and with bricks and with all kinds of labor in the fields, all their work that they worked with them with back breaking labor.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one who was named Shifrah, and the second, who was named Puah.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he said, "When you deliver the Hebrew women, and you see on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall put him to death, but if it is a daughter, she may live."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The midwives, however, feared God; so they did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them, but they enabled the boys to live.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, that you have enabled the boys to live?"</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are skilled as midwives; when the midwife has not yet come to them, they have [already] given birth."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">God benefited the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very strong.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Now it took place when the midwives feared God, that He made houses for them.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile, and every daughter you shall allow to live."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">A man of the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The woman conceived and bore a son, and [when] she saw him that he was good, she hid him for three months.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">[When] she could no longer hide him, she took [for] him a reed basket, smeared it with clay and pitch, placed the child into it, and put [it] into the marsh at the Nile's edge.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">His sister stood from afar, to know what would be done to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Pharaoh's daughter went down to bathe, to the Nile, and her maidens were walking along the Nile, and she saw the basket in the midst of the marsh, and she sent her maidservant, and she took it.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">She opened [it], and she saw him the child, and behold, he was a weeping lad, and she had compassion on him, and she said, "This is [one] of the children of the Hebrews."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">His sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call for you a wet nurse from the Hebrew women, so that she shall nurse the child for you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go!" So the girl went and called the child's mother.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will give [you] your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The child grew up, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became like her son. She named him Moses, and she said, "For I drew him from the water."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Now it came to pass in those days that Moses grew up and went out to his brothers and looked at their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man of his brothers.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">He turned this way and that way, and he saw that there was no man; so he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">He went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were quarreling, and he said to the wicked one, "Why are you going to strike your friend?"</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he retorted, "Who made you a man, a prince, and a judge over us? Do you plan to slay me as you have slain the Egyptian?" Moses became frightened and said, "Indeed, the matter has become known!"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Pharaoh heard of this incident, and he sought to slay Moses; so Moses fled from before Pharaoh. He stayed in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Now the chief of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew [water], and they filled the troughs to water their father's flocks.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">But the shepherds came and drove them away; so Moses arose and rescued them and watered their flocks.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">They came to their father Reuel, and he said, "Why have you come so quickly today?"</pasuk><pasuk id="19">They replied, "An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand[s] of the shepherds, and he also drew [water] for us and watered the flocks."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">He said to his daughters, "So where is he? Why have you left the man? Invite him, and let him eat bread."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Moses consented to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I was a stranger in a foreign land."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Now it came to pass in those many days that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed from the labor, and they cried out, and their cry ascended to God from the labor.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">God heard their cry, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And God saw the children of Israel, and God knew.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">Moses was pasturing the flocks of Jethro, his father in law, the chief of Midian, and he led the flocks after the free pastureland, and he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from within the thorn bush, and behold, the thorn bush was burning with fire, but the thorn bush was not being consumed.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So Moses said, "Let me turn now and see this great spectacle why does the thorn bush not burn up?"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The Lord saw that he had turned to see, and God called to him from within the thorn bush, and He said, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am!"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And He said, "Do not draw near here. Take your shoes off your feet, because the place upon which you stand is holy soil."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And He said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look toward God.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the Lord said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of their slave drivers, for I know their pains.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">I have descended to rescue them from the hand[s] of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land, to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Jebusites.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression that the Egyptians are oppressing them.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">So now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and take My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should take the children of Israel out of Egypt?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And He said, "For I will be with you, and this is the sign for you that it was I Who sent you. When you take the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Moses said to God, "Behold I come to the children of Israel, and I say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, 'What is His name?' what shall I say to them?"</pasuk><pasuk id="14">God said to Moses, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh (I will be what I will be)," and He said, "So shall you say to the children of Israel, 'Ehyeh (I will be) has sent me to you.'"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And God said further to Moses, "So shall you say to the children of Israel, 'The Lord God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and this is how I should be mentioned in every generation.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, 'The Lord God of your forefathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, "I have surely remembered you and what is being done to you in Egypt." '</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And I said, 'I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.'</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And they will hearken to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, 'The Lord God of the Hebrews has happened upon us, and now, let us go for a three days' journey in the desert and offer up sacrifices to the Lord, our God.'</pasuk><pasuk id="19">However, I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except through a mighty hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And I will stretch forth My hand and smite the Egyptians with all My miracles that I will wreak in their midst, and afterwards he will send you out.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And I will put this people's favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it will come to pass that when you go, you will not go empty handed.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Each woman shall borrow from her neighbor and from the dweller in her house silver and gold objects and garments, and you shall put [them] on your sons and on your daughters, and you shall empty out Egypt."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">Moses answered and said, "Behold they will not believe me, and they will not heed my voice, but they will say, 'The Lord has not appeared to you.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord said to him, "What is this in your hand?" And he said, "A staff."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And He said, "Cast it to the ground," and he cast it to the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand and take hold of its tail." So Moses stretched forth his hand and grasped it, and it became a staff in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">"In order that they believe that the Lord, the God of their forefathers, has appeared to you, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the Lord said further to him, "Now put your hand into your bosom," and he put his hand into his bosom, and he took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous like snow.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And He said, "Put your hand back into your bosom," and he put his hand back into his bosom, and [when] he took it out of his bosom, it had become again like [the rest of] his flesh.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">"And it will come to pass, that if they do not believe you, and they do not heed the voice of the first sign, they will believe the voice of the last sign.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it will come to pass, if they do not believe either of these two signs, and they do not heed your voice, you shall take of the water of the Nile and spill it upon the dry land, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry land."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Moses said to the Lord, "I beseech You, O Lord. I am not a man of words, neither from yesterday nor from the day before yesterday, nor from the time You have spoken to Your servant, for I am heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">But the Lord said to him, "Who gave man a mouth, or who makes [one] dumb or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">So now, go! I will be with your mouth, and I will instruct you what you shall speak. "</pasuk><pasuk id="13">But he said, "I beseech You, O Lord, send now [Your message] with whom You would send."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the Lord's wrath was kindled against Moses, and He said, "Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite? I know that he will surely speak, and behold, he is coming forth toward you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">You shall speak to him, and you shall put the words into his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will instruct you [both] what you shall do.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he will speak for you to the people, and it will be that he will be your speaker, and you will be his leader.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And you shall take this staff in your hand, with which you shall perform the signs."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Moses went and returned to Jether, his father in law, and he said to him, "Let me go now and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and let me see whether they are still alive." So Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">The Lord said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return to Egypt, for all the people who sought your life have died."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So Moses took his wife and his sons, mounted them upon the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">The Lord said to Moses, "When you go to return to Egypt, see all the signs that I have placed in your hand and perform them before Pharaoh, but I will strengthen his heart, and he will not send out the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And you shall say to Pharaoh, 'So said the Lord, "My firstborn son is Israel." '</pasuk><pasuk id="23">So I say to you, 'Send out My son so that he will worship Me, but if you refuse to send him out, behold, I am going to slay your firstborn son.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Now he was on the way, in an inn, that the Lord met him and sought to put him to death.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">So Zipporah took a sharp stone and severed her son's foreskin and cast it to his feet, and she said, "For you are a bridegroom of blood to me."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">So He released him. Then she said, "A bridegroom of blood concerning the circumcision."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">The Lord said to Aaron, "Go toward Moses, to the desert." So he went and met him on the mount of God, and he kissed him.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which he had sent him and all the signs that He had commanded him.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">So Moses and Aaron went, and they assembled all the elders of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And Aaron spoke all the words that the Lord had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And the people believed, and they heard that the Lord had remembered the children of Israel, and they kneeled and prostrated themselves.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">And afterwards, Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, "So said the Lord God of Israel, 'Send out My people, and let them sacrifice to Me in the desert.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice to let Israel out? I do not know the Lord, neither will I let Israel out."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And they said, "The God of the Hebrews has happened upon us. Now let us go on a three day journey in the desert and sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest He strike us with a plague or with the sword."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">But the king of Egypt said to them, "Why, Moses and Aaron, do you disturb the people from their work? Go to your own labors."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Pharaoh said, "Behold, now the people of the land are many, and you are stopping them from their labors."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">So, on that day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="7">"You shall not continue to give stubble to the people to make the bricks like yesterday and the day before yesterday. Let them go and gather stubble for themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">But the number of bricks they have been making yesterday and the day before yesterday you shall impose upon them; you shall not reduce it, for they are lax. Therefore they cry out, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Let the labor fall heavy upon the men and let them work at it, and let them not talk about false matters."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">So the taskmasters of the people and their officers came out and spoke to the people, saying, "So said Pharaoh, 'I am not giving you stubble.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">You go take for yourselves stubble from wherever you find [it], because nothing will be reduced from your work.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="12">So the people scattered throughout the entire land of Egypt, to gather a gleaning for stubble.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the taskmasters were pressing [them], saying, "Finish your work, the requirement of each day in its day, just as when there was stubble."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the officers of the children of Israel whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had appointed over them were beaten, saying, "Why have you not completed your quota to make bricks like the day before yesterday, neither yesterday nor today?"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">So the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you do this to your servants?</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Stubble is not given to your servants, but they tell us, 'Make bricks,' and behold, your servants are beaten, and your people are sinning."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">But he said, "You are lax, just lax. Therefore, you say, 'Let us go, let us sacrifice to the Lord.'</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And now, go and work, but you will not be given stubble. Nevertheless, the [same] number of bricks you must give."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">The officers of the children of Israel saw them in distress, saying, "Do not reduce [the number] of your bricks, the requirement of each day in its day."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">They met Moses and Aaron standing before them when they came out from Pharaoh's presence.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And they said to them, "May the Lord look upon you and judge, for you have brought us into foul odor in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to place a sword into their hand[s] to kill us."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "O Lord! Why have You harmed this people? Why have You sent me?</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Since I have come to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has harmed this people, and You have not saved Your people."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And the Lord said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for with a mighty hand he will send them out, and with a mighty hand he will drive them out of his land."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">God spoke to Moses, and He said to him, "I am the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob with [the name] Almighty God, but [with] My name YHWH, I did not become known to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And also, I established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings in which they sojourned.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And also, I heard the moans of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians are holding in bondage, and I remembered My covenant.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Therefore, say to the children of Israel, 'I am the Lord, and I will take you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will save you from their labor, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I will take you to Me as a people, and I will be a God to you, and you will know that I am the Lord your God, Who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">I will bring you to the land, concerning which I raised My hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a heritage; I am the Lord.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel, but they did not hearken to Moses because of [their] shortness of breath and because of [their] hard labor.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="11">"Come, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and he will let the children of Israel out of his land."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel did not hearken to me. How then will Pharaoh hearken to me, seeing that I am of closed lips?"</pasuk><pasuk id="13">So the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and He commanded them concerning the children of Israel and concerning Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">These [following] are the heads of the fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn: Enoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Karmi, these are the families of Reuben.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Saul, the son of the Canaanitess, these are the families of Simeon.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And these are the names of Levi's sons after their generations: Gershon, Kehath, and Merari, and the years of Levi's life were one hundred thirty seven years.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei to their families.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the sons of Kehath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, and the years of Kehath's life were one hundred thirty three years.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi; these are the families of the Levites according to their generations.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Amram took Jochebed, his aunt, as his wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, and the years of Amram's life were one hundred thirty seven years.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the sons of Izhar were Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Aaron took to himself for a wife, Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Eleazar, the son of Aaron, took himself [one] of the daughters of Putiel to himself as a wife, and she bore him Phinehas; these are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the Levites according to their families.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">That is Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, "Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their legions."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">They are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let the children of Israel out of Egypt; they are Moses and Aaron.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Now it came to pass on the day that the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,</pasuk><pasuk id="29">that the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh everything that I speak to you."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">But Moses said before the Lord, "Behold, I am of closed lips; so how will Pharaoh hearken to me?"</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">The Lord said to Moses, "See!

They have made themselves a god of gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And now, if You forgive their sin But if not, erase me now from Your book, which You have written."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And the Lord said to Moses: "Whoever has sinned against Me, him I will erase from My book!"</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to you. Behold My angel will go before you. But on the day I make an accounting [of sins upon them], I will bring their sin to account against them."</pasuk><pasuk id="35">Then the Lord struck the people with a plague, because they had made the calf that Aaron had made.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="33"><pasuk id="1">The Lord spoke to Moses: "Go, ascend from here, you and the people you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: 'I will give it to your descendants.'</pasuk><pasuk id="2">I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Jebusites</pasuk><pasuk id="3">to a land flowing with milk and honey; because I will not go up in your midst since you are a stiff necked people, lest I destroy you on the way."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">[When] the people heard this bad news, they mourned, and no one put on his finery.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the Lord said to Moses: "Say to the children of Israel: 'You are a stiff necked people; if I go up into your midst for one moment, I will destroy you; but now, leave off your finery, and I will know what to do to you.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="6">So the children of Israel divested themselves of their finery from Mount Horeb.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Moses took the tent and pitched it for himself outside the camp, distancing [it] from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting, and it would be that anyone seeking the Lord would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it would be that when Moses would go out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each one at the entrance of his tent, and they would gaze after Moses until he went into the tent.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it would be that when Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and He would speak with Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">When all the people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise and prostrate themselves, each one at the entrance of his tent.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Then the Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as a man would speak to his companion, and he would return to the camp, but his attendant, Joshua, the son of Nun, a lad, would not depart from the tent.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Moses said to the Lord: "Look, You say to me: 'Bring this people up!' But You have not informed me whom You will send with me.
