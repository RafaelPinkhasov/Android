And I gathered a large assembly around them.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And I said to them, "We bought our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations with as much as we could afford, and you too will sell your brethren, and they will be sold to us." And they remained silent and could find no answer.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So I said, "The thing you are doing is not good. Is it not so that you will go with the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?</pasuk><pasuk id="10">I, too, and my brothers, and my servants have lent them money and corn. Let us now relinquish this loan.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">As of today, give them back their fields, vineyards, olive trees, and houses, and the hundred silver pieces, and the corn, the wine, and the oil that you lent them."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they said, "We shall return, and we shall not demand of them; so shall we do as you say." And I called the priests and adjured them to do according to this promise.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">I also shook out my garment and said, "So shall God shake out any man who does not fulfill this matter, from his house and from his toil, so shall he be shaken out and empty." Then the entire congregation said, "Amen," and they praised the Lord, and the people did according to this word.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Also, since the day that he commanded me to be a governor in the land of Judea, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, my brethren and I have not eaten the food allotted to the governor.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">But the early governors who were before me burdened the people and took from them for bread and wine above forty silver shekels. Also, their servants ruled over the people, but I did not do that because of the fear of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Also, I adhered to the work of this wall, and we did not buy a field, and all my servants were gathered there over the work.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the Jews and the prefects were one hundred and fifty men, and those who came to us from the nations around us at my table.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And this is what was prepared for one day; one ox, six choice sheep, and birds were prepared for me, and as much as ten days' supply of all types of wine in quantity, and with this, I did not seek the food allotted to the governor, because the work was heavy upon this people.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Remember for me, My God, for good, all that I did for this people."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">Now it came to pass, when it was heard by Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall, and that no breach was left therein; also that until that time I had not erected doors in the gates.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Then Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come and let us meet together in Kefirim in the Valley of Ono"; and they were plotting to do me harm.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing great work, and I cannot go down. Why should the work stop when I leave it and come down to you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they sent to me four times according to this wording, and I answered them according to this wording.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Then Sanballat sent to me according to this wording a fifth time with his servant, and an open letter was in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">It was written in it, "It is heard among the nations, and Gashmu says that you and the Jews are plotting to rebel; therefore, you are building the wall, and you are their king." According to these words,</pasuk><pasuk id="7">"You have also set up speakers to call upon you in Jerusalem, saying, 'There is a king in Judea,' and now it will be reported to the king according to these words; so let us come and take counsel together."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">So I sent to him, saying, "Such as these words that you say never happened; you are inventing them from your heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For they all fear us, saying, 'Let their hands be slackened from the work, and let it not be done,' and now, strengthen my hands."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, and he was confined, and he said, "Let us meet in the House of God, in the midst of the Temple, and let us close the doors of the Temple, for they are coming to assassinate you; tonight they are coming to assassinate you."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">So I said to him, "Will a man like me flee? And who is like me who will enter the Temple and live? I will not enter. "</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him, for he spoke prophecy concerning me, and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">For this he was hired, in order that I fear and do so and sin, so that they should have this for a scandal in order to reproach me.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their deeds, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were frightening me.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">The wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Ellul, after fifty-two days.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Now it came to pass when all our enemies heard that, all the nations around us became frightened, and they fell very low in their own eyes, and they knew that this work had been performed by our God.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Even in those days, the rulers of Judea increasingly sent their letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's were coming to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">For many in Judea were his confederates, for he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and Jehohanan his son had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">They also spoke of his good qualities before me, and they divulged my words to him; Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall had been built and I had erected the doors, that the gatekeepers, the choristers, and the Levites were appointed.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And I put Hanani my brother and Hananiah the ruler of the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he is indeed a truthful man, and he has feared God for a long time.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem shall not be opened until the sun becomes hot, and they [the people] shall stand until they lock the doors and hold them, and station watches among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each one on his watch and each one opposite his house."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Now the city was wide and large, and the people were few within it, and there were no houses built.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the Lord put it into my heart, and I gathered the rulers and the prefects and the people to trace their lineage, and I found the of lineage book of those who had gone up at first, and I found written in it:</pasuk><pasuk id="6">These are the people of the province

And I gathered them and stationed them in their place.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And all of Judah brought the tithes of the corn, and the wine, and the oil to the treasuries.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And I appointed treasurers over the treasuries: Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, for they were deemed trustworthy, and it was incumbent upon them to distribute to their brethren.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not erase my good deeds that I did in the Temple of my God and with its watches.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">In those days, I saw in Judea [people] treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing stacks [of grain] and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, and figs, and all types of loads and bringing them to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, and I warned them on the day they sold provisions.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the Tyrians [who] sojourned there were bringing fish and all [types of] merchandise and selling on the Sabbath to the people of Judea and in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And I quarreled with the dignitaries of Judea, and I said to them, "What is this bad thing that you are doing-profaning the Sabbath day?</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Did not your ancestors do this, and our God brought upon us all this calamity, and upon this city, and you are increasing the wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath?"</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now it came to pass when the gates of Jerusalem cast shadows before the Sabbath, that I commanded, and the doors were closed, and I said that they should not open them until after the Sabbath, and I stationed some of my youths over the gates so that no load should enter on the Sabbath day.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So the traffickers and the vendors of all types of merchandise lodged outside Jerusalem once and twice.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And I warned them and said to them, "Why are you lodging opposite the wall? If you repeat [this], I shall lay a hand on you." Since that time, they did not come on the Sabbath.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And I commanded the Levites that the watchers of the walls should purify themselves and come to hallow the Sabbath day. This too remember for me, my God, and have pity on me according to Your abundant loving-kindness.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Also in those days, I saw the Jews who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite, and Moabite women.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And half their children were speaking Ashdodite, and they did not know how to speak Hebrew, and [so it was] with the language of every people.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And I quarreled with them, and I cursed them, and I struck some of them, and I plucked out their hair, and I adjured them by God, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters either for your sons or for yourselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin with these, although there was no king like him among the great nations, beloved by his God, Who appointed him king over all Israel? The foreign women caused even him to sin.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil to betray our God to marry foreign women?"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the High Priest, was the son-in- law of Sanballat the Horonite, and I drove him away from me.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Remember them, my God, that they defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">But I purified them of everything alien, and I appointed watches of the priests and of the Levites, each one in his work.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And concerning the wood offering at appointed times and concerning the first-fruits, remember for me, my God, favorably.</pasuk></chapter></book>
