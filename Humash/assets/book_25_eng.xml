But they neither obeyed nor hearkened to Me, said the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">[As for] your fathers-where are they? But the prophets-do they live forever?</pasuk><pasuk id="6">But My words and My decrees that I commanded My servants, the prophets-did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said: "As the Lord of Hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways and according to our deeds, so He did to us."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month-that is, the month of Shevat-in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="8">I saw tonight, and behold! A man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtles that were in the pool, and after him were red, black, and white horses.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I said, "What are these, my lord?" and the angel who was speaking to me said to me, "I will show you what these are."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the man standing among the myrtles replied and said, "These are the ones whom the Lord has sent to walk to and fro on the earth."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they answered the angel of the lord who was standing among the myrtles, and they said, "We have walked to and fro on the earth, and behold!

How long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem and upon the cities of Judah, upon whom You are wroth for seventy years already?"</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the Lord answered the angel who was speaking to me, good words-yea, consoling words.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the angel who was speaking to me said to me, "Proclaim, saying: 'So said the Lord of Hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion-great jealousy.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease, for I was wroth a little, and they helped to do harm.'</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Therefore, so said the Lord: 'I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; My house shall be built there,' says the Lord of Hosts. 'And a plumb line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.'</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Further, proclaim, saying: so said the Lord of Hosts, 'My cities shall yet spread out with prosperity, and the Lord shall yet console Zion and shall yet choose Jerusalem.'

And he said, saying, "These are the horns that scattered Judah to the extent that no man raised his head. And these came to cause them to quake, to cast away the horns of the nations that bear a horn against the land of Judah, to scatter it."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And I lifted my eyes, and I saw-and behold!-a man with a measuring line in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how much is its breadth and how much [is] its length."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was coming forth, and another angel was coming forth toward him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he said to him, "Run, speak to this young man, saying: 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited like unwalled towns, because of the multitude of men and cattle therein.'

Flee from the land of the north, says the Lord; for I have spread you as the four corners of the heavens, says the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Ho, Zion! Flee, she who sits among the nation of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For so said the Lord of Hosts: After glory, He sent me to the nations that plunder you, for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">For, behold! I raise My hand over them, and they shall be prey for those who serve them. And you shall know that the Lord of Hosts sent me.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, behold!

And Satan was standing on his right, to accuse him.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord said to Satan: The Lord shall rebuke you, O Satan; and the Lord shall rebuke you, He who chose Jerusalem. Is this one not a brand plucked from fire?</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Now Joshua was wearing filthy garments and standing before the angel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he [the angel] raised his voice and said to those standing before him, saying, "Take the filthy garments off him." And he said to him, "See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I have clad you with clean garments."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And I said, "Let them put a pure miter on his head," and they put the pure miter on his head. And they had clothed him with garments while the angel of the Lord was standing.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the angel of the Lord warned Joshua, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="7">So said the Lord of Hosts: If you walk in My ways, and if you keep My charge, you, too, shall judge My house, and you, too, shall guard My courtyards, and I will give you free access among these who stand by.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Hearken, now, O Joshua the High Priest-you and your companions who sit before you, for they are men worthy of a miracle-for, behold! I bring My servant, the Shoot.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For, behold the stone that I have placed before Joshua. Seven eyes are directed to one stone. Behold! I untie its knots, says the Lord of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">On that day, says the Lord of Hosts, you shall call-each man to his neighbor-to come under his vine and under his fig tree.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And the angel who spoke with me returned, and he awakened me as a man who wakes up from his sleep.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he said to me, "What do you see?"

And I said, "No, my lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he answered and spoke to me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: 'Not by military force and not by physical strength, but by My spirit,' says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you sink to a plain! He will bring out the stone of the main architect, with shouts of grace, grace to it."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Zerubbabel's hands founded this house, and his hands shall complete [it], and you shall know that the Lord of Hosts sent me to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">For, whoever despised the day of small things shall rejoice and see the plummet in Zerubbabel's hand; these, sevenfold; the eyes of the Lord are roving to and fro throughout all the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And I raised my voice and said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the candelabrum and on its left?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And I raised my voice a second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches beside the two golden vats that empty out the gold[en oil] from themselves?"</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he spoke to me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand before the Lord of all the earth."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">And I returned, and I lifted my eyes and saw-and behold!-there was a flying scroll.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he said to me, "What do you see?" and I said, "I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And he said to me; This is the curse that comes forth upon the face of the entire land; for, whoever stole was cleared from such as this, and whoever swore was cleared from such as this.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">I have brought it forth, says the Lord of Hosts, and it shall come into the house of the thief and into the house of him that swears in My Name falsely. And it shall lodge in the midst of his house and destroy him, and his wood, and his stones.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the angel who was speaking to me came forth, and he said to me, "Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that is coming forth."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I said, "What is it?"

A talent of lead was being lifted, and this one woman was sitting in the midst of the ephah.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he said, "This is Wickedness. " And he cast her into the midst of the ephah, and he cast the lead weight into her mouth.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I lifted my eyes, and I saw-and behold!-two women were coming forth with wind in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of the stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And I said to the angel who spoke to me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And he said to me, "To build a house for it in the land of Shinar, and it will be prepared, and they shall place it there on its base."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And I returned and lifted my eyes and saw-and behold!- four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of copper.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot were black horses.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And in the third chariot were white horses, and in the fourth chariot were spotted, ash-colored horses.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And I raised my voice and said to the angel who spoke to me, "What are these, my lord?"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the angel replied and said to me, "These are the four corners of the heavens coming forth from standing beside the Lord of the entire earth."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">The one [chariot] the black horses were in was going forth to the northland, and the white ones went forth after them. And the spotted ones went forth to the southland.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the ash-colored ones went forth and begged to go to walk to and fro on the earth. And He said, "Go, walk to and fro on the earth." And they walked to and fro on the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he cried out to me, saying, "Look, those going forth to the northland have eased My spirit in the northland."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Take from the exiles-from Heldai and from Tobijah and from Jedaiah-and you, yourself, shall come on that day, and you shall come to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, who have come from Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And you shall take silver and gold, and you shall make crowns, and place [them] upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the High Priest.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And you shall speak to him, saying, "So said the Lord of Hosts, saying: Behold a man whose name is the Shoot, who will spring up out of his place and build the Temple of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear glory. And he shall sit and rule on his throne, and the priest shall be on his throne. And a counsel of peace shall be between them [both].</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the crowns shall be for Helem, and for Tobijah, and for Jedaiah, and for Hen the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the Temple of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And distant ones shall come and build in the Temple of the Lord, and you shall know that the Lord of Hosts sent me to you. And it shall come to pass if you hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Darius; The word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth of the ninth month, in Kislev.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Sharezer and Regem Melech and his men sent to Bethel to pray before the Lord,</pasuk><pasuk id="3">to say to the Priests of the house of the Lord of Hosts and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month, abstaining as I have done these many years?"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the word of the Lord of Hosts came to me, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Say to all the people of the land and to the priests saying: When you fasted and mourned in the fifth [month] and in the seventh [month] even these seventy years, did you fast for Me, even for Me?</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And when you eat and when you drink-are you not the ones who eat and you the ones who drink?</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Was it not the words that the Lord proclaimed through the former prophets, when Jerusalem was settled and tranquil, and its cities were around it, and the Negev and the lowland were settled?</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So said the Lord of Hosts, saying: Execute true judgment and perform loving-kindness and mercy, each one [of you] to his brother.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Do not oppress the widow, the orphan, the stranger, or the poor man. Neither shall any of you think evil against his brother in your heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">But they refused to listen; and they turned a rebellious shoulder; and they made their ears heavy, not to hear.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they made their heart [as hard] as a shamir, [in order] not to listen to the Torah and to the words that the Lord of Hosts sent, through His spirit by the earlier prophets. And there was great anger from the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And it came about; as He called and they did not hearken, so shall they call and I will not hearken, said the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And with a whirlwind I will scatter them among all the nations whom they did not know. And the land shall be waste after them with no one passing through or returning. They made a precious land a desolation.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="8"><pasuk id="1">And the word of the Lord of Hosts came [to me], saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">So said the Lord of Hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and with great fury I am jealous for her.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So said the Lord: I will return to Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth, and the mount of the Lord of Hosts [shall be called] the holy mountain.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">So said the Lord of Hosts: Old men and women shall yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of old age.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the streets of the city shall be filled, with boys and girls playing in its streets.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">So said the Lord of Hosts: As it will be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, it will also be wonderful in My eyes, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">So said the Lord of Hosts: Behold I will save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I shall be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So said the Lord of Hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were [prophesying] in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of Hosts was laid, even the Temple, that it might be built.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">For before those days, there was no hire for man; neither was there any hire for beast. And for him that went out or came in, there was no peace because of the adversary, and I would incite all men, each one against his neighbor.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">But now I am not [the same] to the remnant of this people as in the early days, said the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For the sowing is for peace.

And a king was lost from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the strangers shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I will remove his blood from his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth. And it, too, shall remain to our God: and it shall be like a studyhall in Judah; and Ekron, like Jebusi.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And I will encamp beside My house against a garrison of those passing by and of those returning. And no oppressor shall pass by them, for now I have seen with My eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Be exceedingly happy, O daughter of Zion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold! Your king shall come to you.

Therefore, they traveled like sheep; they were humbled, for there is no shepherd.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">My wrath is kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit upon the goats, for the Lord of Hosts has remembered His flock, the house of Judah, and He has made it as His majestic horse in battle.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Out of them shall come the cornerstone; out of them, the stake; out of them, the bow of war. Out of them shall come every oppressor together.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they shall be like mighty men, treading the mire of the streets in battle. And they shall wage war, for the Lord is with them. And they shall shame the riders of horses.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and the house of Joseph I will save.

And the poor of the flock that kept My word knew this, that it was the word of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And I said to them: "If it pleases you, give [Me] My hire, and if not, forbear." And they weighed out My hire: thirty pieces of silver.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the Lord said to me: Cast it to the keeper of the treasury, to the stronghold of glory-of which I stripped them.

I am setting up a shepherd in the land. Those that are cut off he shall not remember; the foolish ones he shall not seek. The lame he shall not heal; the one that can stand he shall not bear. And the flesh of the fat one he shall eat, and their hoofs he shall break.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Ho, worthless shepherd, who abandons the flock! A sword is on his arm and his right eye; his arm shall wither, and his right eye shall dim.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="12"><pasuk id="1">The prophecy of the word of the Lord concerning Israel: Says the Lord, Who stretches out the heavens and founds the earth and forms the spirit of man within him:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Behold!

And they shall look to me because of those who have been thrust through [with swords], and they shall mourn over it as one mourns over an only son and shall be in bitterness, therefore, as one is embittered over a firstborn son.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">On that day there shall be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddon.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the land shall mourn, every family apart: The family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">All the remaining families-every family apart, and their wives apart.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="13"><pasuk id="1">On that day, a spring shall be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for purification and for sprinkling.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And it shall come to pass on that day, says the Lord of Hosts: I will cut off the names of the idols from the earth, and they shall no longer be mentioned. And also the prophets and the spirit of contamination I will remove from the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And it shall come to pass, if a man still prophesies, that his father and his mother-his parents-shall say to him, "You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the Lord." And his father and his mother-his parents-shall thrust him through because of his prophesying.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And it shall come to pass on that day that the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies; and they will not wear a hairy mantle in order to lie.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he shall say, "I am not a prophet! I am a tiller of the soil, for a man entrusted me with his cattle from my youth."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And one will say to him, "What are these wounds between your hands?" And he shall say, "That I was smitten in the house of my friends."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">O sword, awaken against My shepherd and against the man who is associated with Me! says the Lord of Hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the flock shall scatter, and I will return My hand upon the little ones.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it shall come to pass throughout all the land, says the Lord, two parts of it shall be cut off. They shall perish, and the third shall remain therein.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I will bring the third in fire; and I will refine them as one refines silver, and I will test them as one tests gold. He shall call in My name, and I will respond to him. I said, "He is My people"; and he shall say, "The Lord is my God."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="14"><pasuk id="1">Behold! A day of the Lord is coming, and your plunder shall be shared within you.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to wage war; and the city shall be captured, and the houses shall be plundered, and the women shall be ravished, and half the city shall go forth into exile-and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the Lord shall go forth and wage war with those nations, like the day he waged war on the day of the battle.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And on that day His feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem from the east. And the Mount of Olives shall split in the midst thereof-toward the east and toward the west-a very great valley. And half the mountain shall move to the north, and half of it to the south.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach Azal. And you shall flee as you fled because of the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah the King of Judah. And the Lord,my God, shall come; all holy ones with you.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And it shall come to pass on that day that there shall be no light, only disappearing light and thick darkness.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it shall be one day that shall be known to the Lord, neither day nor night; and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it shall come to pass on that day that spring water shall come forth from Jerusalem; half of it to the eastern sea, and half of it to the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the Lord shall become King over all the earth; on that day shall the Lord be one, and His name one.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The whole earth shall be changed to be like a plain, from the hill of Rimmon in the south of Jerusalem; but it [Jerusalem] will be elevated high and remain in its old place; from the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, until the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel until the king's wine-cellars.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more destruction; but Jerusalem shall dwell in safety.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the nations who besieged Jerusalem; his flesh will waste away while he still stands on his feet; his eyes will waste away in their sockets, and his tongue shall waste away in his mouth.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And it will come to pass on that day that there will be great consternation, sent by the Lord upon them; each one shall seize the hand of the other, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of the other.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Yea, even Judah will fight against Jerusalem! And the wealth of all the nations round about-gold and silver and apparel-will be gathered in very great abundance.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And so will be the plague of the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and all the animals that are in those camps, similar to this plague.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And it will come to pass that everyone left of the nations who came up against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to prostrate himself to the King, the Lord of Hosts, and to celebrate the festival of Tabernacles.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And it shall be that whoever of all the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to prostrate himself to the King, the Lord of Hosts-upon them there shall be no rain.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And if the family of Egypt does not go up and does not come, it shall not [rain] upon them. The plague [on Egypt] will be [the same as] that with which the Lord will plague the nations who do not go up to celebrate the festival of Tabernacles.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Such will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the festival of Tabernacles.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">On that day there will be upon the bells of the horses, "holy to the Lord"; and the pots in the House of the Lord will be like the sprinkling bowls before the altar.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the Lord of Hosts, and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and cook in them; and there will no longer be a trafficker in the House of the Lord of Hosts on that day.</pasuk></chapter></book>
