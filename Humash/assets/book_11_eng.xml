' " And Elijah went.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the messengers returned to him, and he said, "Why have you returned?"</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And they said to him, "A man came up toward us and said to us, 'Go return to the king who sent you, and you shall speak to him, [saying,] "So has the Lord said, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed upon which you have ascended, you will not descend, for you will die.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he spoke to them, saying, "What was the manner of the man who came up toward you, and spoke these words to you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they said, "He was a hairy man, with a leather belt girded around his waist." And he said, "He is Elijah the Tishbite."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And he sent to him a captain of fifty men and his fifty men; and he went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on a mountain top, and he spoke to him, saying, "O man of God, the King has spoken; come down!"</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Elijah replied, and spoke to the captain of fifty, "Now, if I am a man of God, let a fire come down from the heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" And a fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty men, and he raised and spoke to him, saying, "O man of God, so said the King, 'Come down quickly!' "</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Elijah raised his voice and spoke to them, [saying,] "If I am a man of God, let a fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" And an enormous fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And again he sent a third captain of fifty and his fifty men; and the third captain of fifty climbed up and came and kneeled on his knees opposite Elijah and implored him and spoke to him, saying, "O man of God, may my soul and the soul of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Behold, a fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; now may my soul be precious in your eyes."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, "Go down with him: fear him not." And he arose and went down with him to the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he spoke to him, saying, "So has the Lord said, 'Since you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron (Is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word?), therefore, from the bed upon which you have risen, you will not get down, for you shall die.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken; and Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, for he had no son.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the remaining deeds of Ahaziah that he did are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">And it was when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha went from Gilgal.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here now for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel," but Elisha said, "As the Lord lives and by the life of your soul, I will not leave you." And they went down to Bethel.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the disciples of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that today the Lord will take your master from you?" And he said, "I know it too. Be quiet."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Elijah said to him, "Stay here now, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho." And he said, "As the Lord lives and by your life, I will not leave you." And they came to Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the disciples of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that today the Lord will take your master from you?" And he said, "I know it too. Be quiet."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Elijah said to him, "Stay here now, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan." And he said, "As the Lord lives and by your life, I will not leave you." And they both went.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And fifty men of the disciples of the prophets went and stood opposite them from a distance, as they both stood at the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water, and it divided to this side and to that side; and they both crossed on dry land.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it was when they crossed, that Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you, while I am not yet taken away from you." And Elisha said, "Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And he said, "You have made a difficult request. If you see me taken from you, it will be so to you, and if not, it will not be."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it was that they were going, walking and talking, and behold a fiery chariot and fiery horses, and they separated them both. And Elijah ascended to heaven in a whirlwind.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Elisha saw, and he was crying, "My father! My father! The chariots of Israel and their riders!" And he saw him no longer. Now he took hold of his garments and rent them in two pieces.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he picked up Elijah's mantle that had fallen off him, and he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he took Elijah's mantle that had fallen off him, and he struck the water and said, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" He too struck the water and it divided on this side and on that side, and Elisha crossed.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the disciples of the prophets who were in Jericho saw him from a distance, and they said, "Elijah's spirit has rested on Elisha." And they came toward him and prostrated themselves before him to the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And they said to him, "Behold now, there are with your servants fifty able men. Let them go now and seek your master, perhaps a wind from the Lord has carried him off and thrown him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys." And he said, "You shall not send."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they urged him until he was ashamed. And he said, "Send." And they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And they returned to him when he was staying in Jericho; and he said to them, "Did I not say to you, 'You shall not go'?"</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the people of the city said to Elisha, "Behold the city is a good place to live in, as my lord sees, but the water is bad and the land causes people to die.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he said, "Take me to a new jug and put salt therein," and they took to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he went out to the source of the water and threw salt there; and he said, "So has the Lord said, 'I have cured these waters; there will no longer be death and bereavement from there.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the water became cured to this day, according to the word of Elisha that he spoke.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And he went up from there to Bethel, and he was going up on the road and some little boys came out of the city and jeered him, and said to him, "Go away, baldy; go away, baldy!"</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And he turned around and saw them, and he cursed them in the name of God. And two she-bears came out of the forest and tore apart forty-two boys of them.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And he went from there to Mt. Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">And Jehoram the son of Ahab reigned over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he did what was bad in the eyes of the Lord, however, not like his father and mother; and he removed the monument of the Baal that his father had made.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Only to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin did he cling; he did not turn away from it.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Now Mesha the king of Moab was a sheepman; and he would repeatedly pay tribute to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and one hundred thousand rams with their wool.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And it was, that when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Now King Jehoram went out of Samaria on that day, and counted all Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he went and called Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to war against Moab?" And he said, "I will go up. I will be like you, my people like your people, my horses like your horses."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he said, "By which road shall we go up?" And he said, "By way of the Desert of Edom."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the king of Israel and the king of Judah and the king of Edom went, and they went around, a journey of seven days; and there was no water for the camp or for the animals that were with them.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the king of Israel said, "Alas! For the Lord has called these three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab!"</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no prophet of the Lord here that we may inquire of the Lord through him?" And one of the king of Israel's servants answered, "Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on Elijah's hands."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the Lord is with him." And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do I have [to do] with you? Go to your father's prophets and to your mother's prophets!" And the king of Israel said to him, "Don't [say that], for the Lord has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Elisha said, "As the Lord of Hosts, before Whom I have stood, lives, for were it not that I respect Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would neither look at you nor would I see you."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">"And now fetch me a musician." And it was that when the musician played, the hand of the Lord came upon him."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he said, "So has the Lord said, 'This valley will be made full of pools.'</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For so has the Lord said, 'You shall not see wind neither shall you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water; and you and your cattle and your beasts shall drink.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And this will be slight in the eyes of the Lord, and He will deliver Moab into your hands.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and you shall fell every good tree, and you shall stop up all springs of water, and you shall clutter every good field with stones."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And it was in the morning when the meal-offering was offered up, that, behold, water was coming from the road of Edom; and the land became filled with the water.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to wage war with them; and they assembled, everyone old enough to gird a sword and older, and they stood at the border.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they arose early in the morning, when the sun shone on the water; and the Moabites saw the water from a distance, red as blood.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And they said, "This is blood! The kings have fought with each other and have killed each other. And now, to the spoils, Moab!"</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they came to the Israelite camp, and the Israelites arose and struck the Moabites, and they fled from before them; and they attacked them, and slew the Moabites.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they demolished the cities, and each one threw his stone on every fertile field and filled it up, and they stopped up every water spring and they felled every good tree until they left over its stones only in Kir-Haresheth; and the catapultists surrounded and struck it.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the king of Moab saw that the men of war were stronger than he and he took with him seven hundred men who drew their swords, to break a way to the king of Edom, yet they were unable.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And he took his first-born who would reign after him, and brought him up for a burnt-offering on the wall. And there was great wrath upon Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to the land.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">Now a woman, of the wives of the disciples of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your servant, my husband, has died, and you know that your servant did fear the Lord; and the creditor has come to take my two children for himself as slaves."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me what you have in the house." And she said, "Your maidservant has nothing at all in the house except a jug of oil."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And he said, "Borrow vessels for yourself from outside, from all your neighbors; do not borrow only a few empty vessels.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And you shall come and close the door about yourself and about your sons, and you shall pour upon all these vessels; and the full one you shall carry away."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And she went away from him and closed the door about herself and about her sons; they were bringing [vessels] to her and she was pouring.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And it was when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel," and he said to her, "There is no other vessel." And the oil stopped.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And she came and told the man of God: and he said, "Go sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons will live with the remainder."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it was that day that Elisha went as far as Shunem, and there was a prominent woman who prevailed upon him to eat a meal; and it was, whenever he would pass, he would stop there to eat a meal.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And she said to her husband, "Behold now I know that he is a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now let us make a small walled upper chamber, and place there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp; and it will be that when he comes to us, he will turn into there.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it was one day that he went there, that he turned into the upper chamber and lay down there.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And he said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunemitess;" and he called her, and she stood before him.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he said to him, "Please say to her, 'Behold you have busied yourself on our account with all this trouble. What is there to do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or to the general of the army?' " And she said, "I dwell in the midst of my people."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he said, "Now what can we do for her? " And Gehazi said, "Indeed, she has no son, and her husband is old."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he said, "Summon her," and he summoned her, and she stood at the doorway.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he said, "At this time next year, when you will be alive like now, you will be embracing a son." And she said, "No, my lord, O man of God, do not fail your maidservant."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the woman conceived and bore a son, at this time a year later, which Elisha had spoken to her.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the child grew up; and it was one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And he said to his father, "My head! My head!" And he said to the servant, "Carry him to his mother."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he carried him and brought him to his mother, and he sat on her knees until noon, and he died.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and she closed about him and left.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And she called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and one of the she-asses; and I will run up to the man of God and return."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And he said, "Why are you going to him today; it is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath." And she said, "It's all right."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And she saddled the she-ass, and she said to her servant, "Drive and go forward. Don't keep back from riding because of me unless I tell you."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And she went and came to the man of God, to Mt. Carmel; and it was when the man of God saw her from afar, that he said to Gehazi his servant, "Here is that Shunemmitess.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">"Now please run toward her, and say to her, 'Are you well? Is your husband well? Is the child well?' " And she said, "We are well."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And she came to the man of God to the mountain, and she took hold of his feet; and Gehazi approached to push her away. Now the man of God said, "Let her be, for her soul is bitter to her, and the Lord hid it from me and did not tell me."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And she said, "Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, 'Do not mislead me?' "</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And he said to Gehazi, "Gird your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him: and you shall place my staff on the lad's face."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And the lad's mother said, "As the Lord lives and by your life, I will not leave you." And he rose and went after her.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And Gehazi went ahead of them, and he placed the staff on the lad's face, and there was no sound nor any attention; and he returned toward him and told him saying, "The lad has not awakened."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Elisha came into the house, and behold the lad was dead, laid out on his bed.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And he came and closed the door about both of them; and he prayed to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And he went up and lay on the child, and placed his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his palms on his palms, and he prostrated himself upon him: and the child's flesh became warm.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And he returned and walked in the house once here and once there, and he went up and prostrated himself upon him: and the lad sneezed up to seven times, and the lad opened his eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And he summoned Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunemmitess." And he called her, and she came to him, and he said, "Pick up your son."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And she came and fell at his feet and bowed to the ground; and she picked up her son and departed.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Elisha returned to Gilgal; and the famine was in the land, and the disciples of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said to his servant, "Set the large pot on the fire and cook a stew for the disciples of the prophets."</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And one went out to the field to gather herbs; and he found a vine in the field and gathered from it wild mushrooms his garment full; and he came and diced them into the pot of stew, for they did not know.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And they poured for the people to eat; and it was when they were eating of the stew, that they cried out and said, "Death is in the pot, O man of God!" and they could not eat.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And he said, "Fetch flour," and he threw [it] into the pot, and he said, "Pour it for the people and let them eat. " And there was no harmful substance in the pot.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And a man came from Baal-Shalishah, and he brought to the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley bread and sheaves of fresh grain in their shells; and he said, "Give to the people and let them eat.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And his servant said, "How will I give this before one hundred men? And he said, "Give the people and let them eat, for so has the Lord said, 'They shall eat and leave over.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And he placed it before them, and they ate and left over, according to the word of the Lord.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">Now Naaman, the general of the king of Aram, was a prominent man before his lord and respected, for through him had the Lord given victory to Aram; and the man was a great warrior, and he was a mezora.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Now the Arameans went out in bands and captured from the land of Israel a young girl, who ministered to Naaman's wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And she said to her mistress, "The supplications for my master should be that he go before the prophet who is in Samaria; then he would cure him of his zaraath.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he came and told his master, saying, "In the following manner has the girl from the land of Israel spoken."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the king of Aram said, "Come, go and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." He went and took in his possession ten talents of silver and six thousand gold pieces, and ten suits of clothes.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the letter came to the king of Israel, saying, "And now, when this letter comes to you, behold I have sent Naaman my servant to you, and you shall cure him of his zaraath.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it was when the king of Israel read the letter, that he rent his garments, and said, "Do I have power from God to put to death and to bring to life, that this one sends to me to cure a man of his zaraath? Just know now and see that he is looking for a pretext against me."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it was when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you rent your garments? Let him come to me now, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and he stood at the doorway of Elisha's house.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Elisha dispatched a messenger to him, saying, "Go and immerse yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored to you, and you will become clean."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Now Naaman became incensed, and he went away, and he said, "Here I thought that he would come out to see me, and he would stand and call in the name of YHVH his God, and he would raise his hand toward the spot and cure the mezora."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Are not Amanah and Parpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Will I not immerse myself in them and become clean?" And he turned and went away in anger.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And his servants approached and spoke to him and said, "Master, if the prophet spoke to you to do a difficult thing, would you not do it? And surely since he said to you, 'Immerse yourself and become clean.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he went down and immersed himself in the Jordan seven times according to the word of the man of God: and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young lad, and he became clean.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he returned to the man of God, he and his entire camp; and he came and stood before him: and he said, "Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. And now, accept a gift from your servant."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he said, "As the Lord before Whom I have stood, lives, I will not accept." And he urged him to accept, but he refused.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Naaman said, "Now, if only your servant be given a load of earth as carried by a team of mules, for your servant will no longer offer up a burnt-offering or a sacrifice to other deities, but to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">For this thing may the Lord forgive your servant; when my master comes to Beth-Rimmon to prostrate himself there, and he leans on my hand, and I will prostrate myself in Beth-Rimmon; when I bow in Beth-Rimmon, may the Lord forgive your servant for this thing."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And he said to him, "Go in peace"; and he went some distance away from him.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, "Here my master has stopped Naaman, this Aramean, from giving, by not taking from his hand what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Gehazi chased after Naaman; and Naaman saw him running after him, and he leaned over off the chariot toward him, and said, "Is all well?"</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And he said, "All is well. My master sent me, saying, "Here, just now two youths have come to me from Mt. Ephraim, of the disciples of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and two suits of clothing.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Naaman said, "Please take two talents. And he urged him and he tied two talents of silver in two pockets, and two suits of clothing. And he gave his two servants, and they carried them before him.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And he came to a secret place, and he took [them] from their hands, and he deposited them in the house. And he dismissed the men, and they went away.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And he came and stood before his master, and Elisha said to him, "Where are you coming from, Gehazi?" And he said, "Your servant has gone neither here nor there."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And he said to him, "Did my heart not go when a man turned around off his chariot toward you? Is it time to take the silver, and to buy clothing and olive trees and vineyards and sheep and cattle and slaves and maidservants?</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Now Naaman's zaraath shall cling to you and to your children forever." And he went away from before him, stricken with zaraath, [white] as snow.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And the disciples of the prophets said to Elisha, "Behold now the place where we are sitting before you is too narrow for us.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Let us go now to the Jordan and take from there each man one beam, and let us make a place for ourselves to sit there." And he said, "Go."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And one said, "Please be willing to go with your servants." And he said, "I will go."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he went with them, and they came to the Jordan, and cut down the trees.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">One was casting down the beam, and with the axe blade it fell into the water. He cried out and said, "Alas, master, it is borrowed!"</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the man of God said to him, "Where did it fall?" And he showed him the spot, and he cut off a piece of wood and threw it there, and the axe blade floated.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he said, "Pick it up for yourself." And he stretched out his hand and took it.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the king of Aram was waging war with Israel; and he held council with his servants, saying, "In a hidden, secret place I will encamp."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, "Beware of passing this place, for there the Arameans are encamped."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the king of Israel sent to the place concerning which the man of God had told him and cautioned him, and he took precautions there, not once and not twice.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the king of Aram was greatly disturbed about this matter, and he summoned his servants and said to them, "Will you not tell me who of ours [reveals my secrets] to the king of Israel?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And one of his servants said, "No, my master, the King, but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he said, "Go and see where he is, and I will send and take him." And it was told to him saying, "Behold he is in Dothan."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he sent there horses and chariots and a great army; and they came at night and surrounded the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, and behold an army with horses and chariots was surrounding the city. And his attendant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he said, "Have no fear, for those who are with us are more numerous than those who are with them."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Elisha prayed and said, "O Lord, please open his eyes and let him see." And the Lord opened the lad's eyes and he saw, and behold the mountain was full of fiery horses and chariots around Elisha.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And they came down to him, and Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, "Please strike this people with blindness; and He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Elisha said to them, "Neither is this the way nor is this the city. Follow me and I will lead you to the man you seek." And he led them to Samaria.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And it was when they came to Samaria, that Elisha said, "O Lord, open these people's eyes that they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and behold they were in Samaria.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Now the king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them, "Shall I slay them, my lord?"</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And he said, "You shall not slay. Do you slay those you have captured with your sword and with your bow? Set food and water for them and let them eat and drink and go to their masters.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And he prepared for them a lavish feast, and they ate and drank, and he sent them away and they went to their masters; and Aramean troops no longer continued to invade the land of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And it was after this, that Ben-Hadad the king of Aram, mustered all his camp; and he went up and besieged Samaria.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Now there was a severe famine in Samaria, and behold they were besieging it, until a donkey's head sold for eighty silver pieces and a quarter of a kab of doves' dung sold for five silver pieces.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the king of Israel was passing on the wall, when a woman cried out to him, saying, "Save [me] my lord the king!"</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And he said, "If the Lord will not save you, whence shall I save you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And the king said to her, "What troubles you?" And she said, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son and let us eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And we cooked my son and ate him. And I said to her the next day 'Give up your son and let us eat him.' But she hid her son."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And it was when the king heard the woman's words that he rent his garments while he was passing on the wall, and the people saw, and behold there was sackcloth on his flesh underneath.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And he said, "So shall God do to me and so shall He continue, if Elisha the son of Shaphat's head remain on him today."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him: and he sent a man from before him. When the messenger had not yet arrived, he said to the elders, "Have you seen that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head? See that when the messenger comes that you close the door and you shall hold the door fast against him. Surely, the sound of his master's footsteps will follow him."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">While he was still speaking with them, behold the messenger was coming down to him. And he said, "Behold, this calamity is from the Lord. What more can I hope for from the Lord?"</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">And Elisha said, "Hearken to the word of the Lord. So has the Lord said, "At this time tomorrow, a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel in the gate of Samaria."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the king's officer upon whose hand he would lean, answered the man of God, and said, "Behold, if the Lord makes windows in the sky, will this thing come about?" And he said, "Behold, you will see with your own eyes, but you shall not eat therefrom."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Now there were four men, stricken with zaraath, [at] the entrance of the gate. And they said to each other, "Why are we sitting here until we die?</pasuk><pasuk id="4">If we say that we will come into the city, with the famine in the city, we will die there, and if we stay here we will die. So now, let us go and let us defect to the Aramean camp. If they spare us we will live, and if they kill us we will die."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they arose in the evening to come to the Aramean camp. And they came to the edge of the Aramean camp, and behold, no one was there.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Now the Lord had caused the Aramean camp to hear the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, the sound of a great army. And they said to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired for us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And they picked themselves up and fled at dusk, leaving behind their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Now these mezoraim came up to the edge of the camp, entered one tent, ate and drank, and carried off from there silver, gold, and clothing, and they went and hid [them]. And they returned and entered another tent, and carried off from there, and they went and hid [them].</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Now one said to another, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, yet we are keeping quiet. If we wait until daybreak, we will incur guilt. Now, let us go and come and relate this in the king's palace."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, saying, "We came to the Aramean camp, and behold there is no man there nor the sound of a human, but the horses are tethered and the donkeys are tethered, and the tents are as they were."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And he called the gatekeepers; and they related it to the king's palace inside.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the king arose at night and said to his servants, "Now I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry. So they left the camp to hide in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we will seize them alive and enter the city.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now one of his servants called out and said, "Let them take now five of the remaining horses that are left there. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel that are left there, behold they are like all the multitude of Israel that have perished; and let us send and we will see."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">So they took two riders of horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean camp, saying, "Go and see."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And they followed them up to the Jordan, and behold all the way was full of garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast off in their haste; and the messengers returned and related it to the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the people went out and plundered the Aramean camp; and a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two seahs of barley were sold for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Now the king appointed the officer upon whose hand he leaned, over the gate, and the people trampled him and he died, as the man of God had spoken, which he spoke when the king had come down to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And it was when the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two seahs of barley will be sold for a shekel and a seah of fine flour will be sold at this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,".</pasuk><pasuk id="19">That the officer answered the man of God and said, "And behold, if God makes windows in the sky, will this thing come about?" And he said, "Behold you will see it with your own eyes, yet you shall not eat therefrom."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And so it happened to him, that the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="8"><pasuk id="1">Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had revived, saying, "Get up and go, you and your household, and sojourn in a place suitable for you to sojourn, for the Lord has decreed a famine, and it is destined to come upon the land for seven years."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the woman got up and did according to the word of the man of God: and she and her household went, and she sojourned in the land of Philistines for seven years.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And it came about at the end of seven years that the woman returned from the land of Philistines; and she went out to complain to the king about her house and about her field.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Now the king was speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, "Please tell me all the great things that Elisha performed."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And it was that he was telling the king that he revived the dead, that the woman whose son he had revived complained to the king about her house and about her field. And Gehazi said, "My lord the king, this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha revived."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the king asked the woman and she told him: and the king appointed for her one eunuch, saying, "Return all her property, and all the produce of the field from the day she left the land until now."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Elisha came to Damascus when Ben-Hadad was ill; and it was told to him, saying, "The man of God is coming here."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the king said to Hazael, "Take a gift in your hand and go toward the man of God, and inquire of the Lord from him, saying, "Will I recover from this illness?"</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Hazael went toward him and took a gift in his hand and all the bounty of Damascus, a load of forty camels; and he came and stood before him and said, "Your son, Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this illness?' "</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Elisha said to him, "Go say to him, 'You will live,' but the Lord has shown me that he will die."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">He made his face expressionless and held it a long time; then the man of God wept.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Hazael said, "Why does my lord weep?" And he said, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set fire to their fortresses, and you will slay their youths with the sword, and you will dash their infants, and you will rip open their pregnant women."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Hazael said, "Now what is your servant, the dog, that he shall perform this mighty deed? " And Elisha said, "The Lord has shown you to me as king over Aram."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he went away from Elisha and came to his master, and he said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And he said, "He said to me, 'You will live.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And it came about on the next day that he took a blanket, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, [after which] he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Jehoram, king of Judah, became king.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">He went in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for a daughter of Ahab became his wife; and he did what was bad in God's eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, as he said to him to give him a kingdom for his children for all times.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">In his days, Edom rebelled from under the power of Judah, and they appointed a king over themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots were with him: and he got up at night and struck the Edomites who came around to him and the officers of the chariots; and the people fled to their dwellings.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Edom rebelled from under the power of Judah until this day; then Libnah rebelled at that time.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the remaining events of Joram and all that he did, are written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Joram slept with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of David.

Hoshea, that he sent messengers to So the king of Egypt and did not pay tribute to the king of Assyria as year by year, and the king of Assyria arrested him and confined him in prison.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the king of Assyria went up through the entire land, and he went up to Samaria and besieged it three years.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and exiled the Israelites to Assyria, and he repatriated them in Halah, and in Habor, the Gozan River, and the cities of Media.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it was, when the children of Israel sinned to the Lord their God, who brought them up from the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and they feared other gods.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they followed the statutes of the nations whom the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel, and [of] the kings of Israel that they practiced.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the children of Israel fabricated things which were not so about the Lord their God, and they built themselves high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And they erected for themselves monuments and asherim on every high hill and under every green tree.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they burned incense there on all the high places, like the nations that the Lord had exiled from before them, and they did evil things to anger the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they worshipped the idols, which the Lord had said to them, "You shall not do this thing."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the Lord warned Israel and Judah through all prophets of all visions, saying, "Repent of your evil ways, and keep My commandments, My statutes, according to the entire Law that I commanded your forefathers, and that I sent to you through My servants, the prophets."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">But they did not heed, and they hardened their nape like the nape of their forefathers who did not believe in the Lord their God.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And they despised His statutes and His covenant that He had enacted with their forefathers and His warnings that He had warned them, and they followed worthless things and became worthless, and after the nations that were around them, concerning whom the Lord had commanded them not to do like them.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And they forsook all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made for themselves two molten calves, and they made an asherah, and they prostrated themselves before the entire host of the heavens, and they worshipped the Baal.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they passed their sons and daughters through fire, and they practiced enchantment and divination, and they committed themselves to do what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, to anger Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the Lord became very much incensed against Israel, and He sent them away from before Him; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Neither did Judah observe the commandments of the Lord their God, and they followed the practices of Israel that they did.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the Lord despised all the seed of Israel, and He afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of plunderers until He cast them away from before Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">For Israel had torn away from the house of David and had appointed Jeroboam the son of Nebat as king, and Jeroboam led Israel astray from following the Lord and caused them to commit a grave sin.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the children of Israel followed all the sins of Jeroboam that he committed; they did not turn away from it.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Until the Lord removed Israel from His Presence, as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets, and Israel went in exile from their land to Assyria until this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylonia and from Cuthah and from Avva and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim, and he settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel, and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And it was in the beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear the Lord, and the Lord incited lions against them, and they were killing them.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And they said to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations that you exiled and settled in the cities of Samaria, do not know the law of the God of the land, and He has incited lions against them, and behold they are killing them, as they do not know the law of the God of the land."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And the king of Assyria commanded, saying, "Bring there one of the priests whom I have exiled from there, and let them go and dwell there, and teach them the law of the God of the land."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And one of the priests whom they had exiled from Samaria came and settled in Bethel, and he would direct them how they should fear the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Now each nation made its god, and they placed [it] in the temple of the high places that the people of Samaria had made, each nation in their cities wherein they were dwelling.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And the people of Babylonia made Succoth-benoth, and the people of Cuth made Nergal, and the people of Hamath made Ashima.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adramelech and Anamelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And they feared the Lord, and they made some of them priests of the high places, and they would practice their [rites] in the temple of the high places.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">They feared the Lord, yet they worshipped their own gods, as was the custom of the nations whom they had exiled from there.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Until this day, they practice just as their earlier practices; they do not fear the Lord, neither do they practice according to their statutes and laws, nor according to the Law and the commandment that the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name He called Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And the Lord enacted a covenant with them, saying, "You shall not fear other gods, neither shall you prostrate yourselves to them nor worship them, and you shall not slaughter [sacrifices] to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">Only the Lord Who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great might and with an outstretched arm, Him shall you fear, and to Him shall you prostrate yourselves and to Him shall you slaughter sacrifices.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And the statutes and the judgments, and the Law and the commandment that He wrote for you, you shall heed to perform all times, and you shall not fear strange gods.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And the covenant that I enacted with you, you shall not forget, neither shall you fear strange gods.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">But the Lord your God you shall fear, and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."</pasuk><pasuk id="40">But they did not obey, but according to their earlier practice they were doing.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And these nations feared the Lord, yet they worshipped their graven images; also their children and their grandchildren, as their forefathers had done, they are doing until this day.</pasuk></chapter><chapter

Lord, like all that his father David had done.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">He abolished the high places, and smashed the monuments, and cut down the asherah, and crushed the copper serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the children of Israel were burning incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">He trusted in the God of Israel there was none like him among all the kings of Judah who were after him, nor were there before him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">He cleaved to the Lord; he did not turn away from following Him; he kept His commandments, which He had commanded Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Now the Lord was with him: in everything he ventured he succeeded; and he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">He slew the

He has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'Before this altar in Jerusalem shall you prostrate yourselves.'</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And now, wager now with my lord the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able to supply riders upon them of your men.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And how can you repulse one captain of the smallest of my master's servants, and you rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Now is it with other than the Lord that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebnah and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic for we understand it; do not speak with us in Judean within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Rabshakeh said to them, "Did my master send me to speak these words to your master and to you? Is it not to the men who sit on the wall to eat their dung and drink their urine with you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in Judean, and he spoke and said, "Listen to the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!</pasuk><pasuk id="29">So has the king said, 'Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And let not Hezekiah make you rely on the Lord, saying, 'The Lord will save us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'</pasuk><pasuk id="31">Do not listen to Hezekiah, for so has the king of Assyria said, "Make peace with me, and come out to me, and each man will eat of his vine and each man of his fig tree, and each man will drink the water of his cistern.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">Until I come and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil yielding olives and honey, and you may live and not die, and do not heed Hezekiah for he will mislead you, saying, 'The Lord will save us.'</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Have the gods of the nations saved each one his land, from the hand of the king of Assyria?</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad, where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
