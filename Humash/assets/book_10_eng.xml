And he said, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And the people took it for an omen, and they hastened and caught it from him and said, "Your brother Ben-Haddad." And he said, "Come and take him." Ben-Haddad went out to him, and he helped him climb up into the chariot.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And he said to him, "The cities which my father took from your father I will return, and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus as my father had made in Samaria. And I will," [said Ahab] "release him with this treaty."
