<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">And there was one man from Ramathaim Zophim, from Mt. Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And that man was wont to go up from his city from appointed time to appointed time, to prostrate himself and to slaughter (peace offerings) to the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh, and there the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinhas, were serving the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And when it was the day, and Elkanah slaughtered (peace offerings), and he would give to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters portions.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And to Hannah he would give one choice portion, for he loved Hannah, and the Lord had shut up her womb.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And her rival would frequently anger her, in order to make her complain, for the Lord had shut up her womb.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And so he would do year by year, as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, so she would anger her, and she wept and would not eat.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Hannah arose after eating and after drinking, and Eli the priest was sitting on the chair beside the doorpost of the Temple of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And she was bitter in spirit, and she prayed to the Lord, and wept.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And she vowed a vow, and said: to Lord of Hosts, if You will look upon the affliction of Your bondswoman, and You will remember me, and You will not forget Your bondswoman and You will give Your bondswoman a man-child, and I shall give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And it was, as she prayed long before the Lord, that Eli watched her mouth.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">But Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were moving, and her voice was not heard, and Eli thought her to be a drunken woman.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Eli said to her: Until when will you be drunk? Throw off your wine from upon yourself.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Hannah answered and said: No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit, and neither new wine nor old wine have I drunk, and I poured out my soul before the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Deliver not your bondswoman before the unscrupulous woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken until now.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Eli answered and said: Go in peace, and the God of Israel will grant your request which you have asked of Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And she said: May your bondswoman find favor in your eyes; and the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was not (sad) anymore.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And they arose early in the morning, and prostrated themselves before the Lord: and they returned and came to their house, to Ramah, and Elkanah knew Hannah, his wife, and the Lord remembered her.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And it was, when the time came about, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, because (she said); "I asked him of the Lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the man, Elkanah and his entire household, went up to slaughter to the Lord, the sacrifice of the days and his vow.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband: "Until the child is weaned, then I shall bring him, and he shall appear before the Lord, and abide there forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Elkanah her husband said to her: "Do what seems good to you. Stay until you have weaned him, only, may the Lord fulfill His word." And the woman stayed and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And she brought him with her when she had weaned him, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and an earthenware jug of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord, to Shiloh, and the child was young.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And she said, "Please, my lord! As surely as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here with you, to pray to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">For this child did I pray, and the Lord granted me my request, which I asked of Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And I also have lent him to the Lord; all the days which he will be alive, he is borrowed by the Lord." And he prostrated himself there to the Lord.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">And Hannah prayed and said: "My heart has rejoiced through the Lord; My horn has been raised by the Lord. My mouth is opened wide against my enemies, For I have rejoiced in Your salvation.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">There is none as holy as the Lord, For there is none besides You; And there is no rock like our God.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Do not increasingly speak haughtily; Let not arrogance come out of your mouth, For the Lord is a God of thoughts, And to Him are deeds counted.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The bows of the mighty are broken; And those who stumbled, are girded with strength.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Those who were satiated have hired themselves out for bread, While the hungry have ceased. While the barren woman has born seven, She that had many children, has been bereaved.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">The Lord kills and makes alive; He brings down to the grave and raises up.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">The Lord impoverishes and makes rich. He humbles; He also exalts.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">He lifts the poor from the dust; From the dunghill, He raises the pauper, To seat them with princes, And a seat of honor He causes them to inherit, For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, And He placed the world upon them.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">The feet of His pious ones He will guard, And the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, For not by strength will man prevail.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Those who strive with the Lord will be broken; Upon him will He thunder in Heaven; The Lord will judge the ends of the earth. And He will grant strength to His King, And raise the horn of His anointed one.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house, and the child was serving the Lord before Eli the priest.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Eli's sons, unscrupulous men, knew not the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And this was the due of the priests from the people: (whenever) any man would slaughter a sacrifice, the servant of the priest would come when (one) cooked the flesh, with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he would thrust into the fire-pot, or into the pot, or into the cauldron, or into the pan, everything which the fork would pick up, the priest would take therewith; so would they do to all Israel who came there in Shiloh.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Also, before they would make the fat smoke, and the servant of the priest would come, and would say to the man who slaughtered, 'Give meat to roast for the priest, and he will not take from you cooked meat, but raw.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And (if) the man said to him, 'Let them make the fat smoke now, and (then) take for yourself, as your soul desires,' And he would say, 'No, but now you shall give. And if not, I shall take by force.'</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the sin of the lads was great before the Lord, for the men despised the offering of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Samuel was serving before the Lord, being a lad girded with a linen robe.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And a small robe his mother would make for him, and she would bring it up to him from appointed time to appointed time, when she ascended with her husband, to slaughter the sacrifice of the (festive) days.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he would say, "May the Lord grant you seed from this woman," because of the request which he had requested of the Lord, and they would go to his place.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">For the Lord remembered Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the lad Samuel grew up with the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Now, Eli had become very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they would lie with the women who congregated at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And he said to them: "Why do you do the likes of these things, for I hear evil reports about you, from all these people.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">No, my sons, for the rumor which I hear the Lord's people spreading, is not good.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">If man will sin to man, the judge will judge him. If, however, he will sin against God, who will intercede in the judgment in his behalf?" But they would not hearken to their father's voice, for the Lord desired to kill them.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the lad, Samuel, was growing up, and bettering himself both with the Lord and with people.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And a man of God came to Eli, and he said to him: "So said the Lord: 'Did I appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt, (enslaved) to the house of Pharaoh?</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And did I choose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer up (sacrifices) on My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? And did I give to the house of your father all the fire-offerings of the children of Israel?</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Why (then,) do you kick at My sacrifice, and at My meal offering which I commanded in My dwelling place, and you honored your sons above Me, before My people, to feed yourselves from the first part of every offering of Israel?</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Therefore," says the Lord, God of Israel, "I said, 'Your house and the house of your father will walk before Me forever,' but now, says the Lord: Far be it from Me, for those who honor Me shall I honor, and those who despise Me will be disgraced.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">Behold days are coming when I shall cut off your arm and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an elder in your household.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And you will look upon a rival (in My) dwelling place in all (the days) which (God) will do good to Israel, and there will not be an elder in your household all of the days.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Yet every man of yours shall I not cut off from My altar, to disappoint you and to sadden your heart; and all those raised in your house will die as young men.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And this is the sign to you, that which will befall your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas; in one day both of them will die.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And I shall raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do as is in My heart and in My mind, and I shall build for him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed all of the days.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And it will be that everyone who is left in your house, will come to prostrate himself before him for a silver piece and a morsel of bread, and will say, "Take me now into one of the priestly divisions in order to eat a morsel of bread."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">And the lad Samuel was serving the Lord before Eli. Now the word of the Lord was withheld in those days; vision had not broken through.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And it was on that day, that Eli was lying in his place, and his eyes had begun to grow dim; he could not see.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down. In the Temple of the Lord, where the Ark of God was.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The Lord called to Samuel, and he said, "Here I am."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he ran to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you have called me." And he said, "I did not call. Go back and lie down." And he went and lay down.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the Lord continued to call again to Samuel, and Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you have called me.'' And he said, "I have not called, my son. Go back and lie down."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Now, Samuel had not yet known the Lord, and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the Lord continued to call Samuel for the third time; and he arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." And Eli understood that that the Lord was calling the youth.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down. And it shall be, if He will call you, that you shall say, 'Speak, O Lord, for Your bondsman is listening.' " And Samuel went and lay down in his place.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the Lord came and stood, and He called as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for Your bondsman is listening."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do something in Israel, about which the two ears of everyone who hears it, will tingle.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">On that day, I shall execute against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his household, beginning and ending.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And I have told him that I am about to execute judgment upon his household forever, for the iniquity (of the matter) that he knew that his sons were bringing disgrace upon themselves, and he did not rebuke them.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And, therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be purged by sacrifice or by offering forever."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Samuel lay down until the morning, and he opened the doors of the House of the Lord. And Samuel was afraid to relate the vision to Eli.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Eli called Samuel, and said, "Samuel, my son!" And he said, "Here I am."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he said, "What is the thing which He spoke to you? Do not conceal from me now. So shall God do to you, and so shall He continue, if you conceal from me anything of the whole matter which He spoke to you."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Samuel told him all the things and did not conceal from him. And he said, "He is the Lord. May He do what is good in His eyes."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Samuel grew up, and the Lord was with him, and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And all Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba, knew that Samuel was established as a prophet to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh with the word of the Lord.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And the word of Samuel was (fulfilled) to all Israel and Israel went out to war against the Philistines, and they encamped beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Philistines arrayed (their troops) against Israel, and the battle spread, and Israel was beaten before the Philistines, and they slew in the battle array in the field, about four thousand men.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the people came to the camp, and the elders of Israel said, "Why has the Lord beaten us today before the Philistines? Let us take to us from Shiloh the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and He will come in our midst, and save us from the hand of our enemies."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the people sent to Shiloh, and from there, they carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts, Who dwells above the cherubim, and there with the Ark of God's Covenant, were Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And it was, when the Ark of the Lord's Covenant came into the camp, that all Israel shouted a great shout, and the earth stirred.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, and they said, "What is the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?" And they knew that the Ark of the Lord had come into the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the Philistines feared, for they said, "God has come into the camp." And they said, "Woe is unto us, for there was nothing like this yesterday and before yesterday!"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">"Woe is unto us! Who will save us from the hand of this mighty God? This is the God who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">"Strengthen yourselves and become men, you Philistines, lest you serve the Hebrews, as they served you, and you shall become men, and fight!"</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the Philistines waged war and Israel was beaten, and they fled, each man to his tents. Now the blow was very great, and there fell from Israel thirty thousand infantrymen.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the Ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And a man of Benjamin ran from the battle array, and came to Shiloh on that day, with his garments torn, and earth upon his head.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he came, and behold, Eli was sitting on the chair beside the road, anxiously waiting, for his heart trembled for the Ark of God. And the man had come to tell in the city, and the whole city cried out.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Now Eli heard the sound of the cry, and he said, "What is this confused noise?" And the man hurried, and came, and told Eli.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now Eli was ninety- eight years old, and his eyes were set, and he could not see.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the man said to Eli, "I am the one who has come from the battle array, and I fled from the battle array today." And he said, "What happened, my son?"</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the one who had reported the news, answered and said, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and also there was a great slaughter among the people, and also your two sons perished, Chofni and Pinchas and the Ark of God was taken."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And it was, when he mentioned the Ark of God, that he (Eli) fell off the chair backward through the gate opening, and his neck broke and he died, because the man was old and weighty and he had judged Israel for forty years.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, ready to give birth, and she heard the news concerning the taking of the Ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband had died. And she knelt and gave birth, for her pains had suddenly come upon her.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And about the time of her dying, the women who were standing by her, said, "Do not fear, for you have borne a son," and she did not answer, neither did she heed.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And she called the child Ichabod, saying, "Glory has been exiled from Israel, because the Ark of God has been taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And she said, "Glory has been exiled from Israel, for the Ark of God has been taken."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">Now, the Philistines had taken the Ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Philistines took the Ark of God and brought it to the house of Dagon, and set it up beside Dagon.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the Ashdodites arose early on the morrow, and behold, Dagon was falling face downward to the ground before the Ark of the Lord, and they returned him to his place.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they arose early the next morning, and behold, Dagon was falling face downward to the ground, before the Ark of the Lord, and Dagon's head and the two palms of his hands were cut off, (and lying) on the threshold; only Dagon('s trunk) alone remained upon him.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Therefore, the priests of Dagon and all those who come to the house of Dagon, do not tread upon the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the hand of the Lord became heavy upon the Ashdodites, and He ravaged them, and He smote them with hemorrhoids, Ashdod and its borders.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the people of Ashdod saw that it was so, and they said, "Let not the Ark of the God of Israel dwell with us, for His hand is severe upon us and upon Dagon, our god.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and they said, "What shall we do to the Ark of the God of Israel?" And they said, "Let the Ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath," and (thereupon), they brought the Ark of the God of Israel around to Gath.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it was, after they had brought it around, that the hand of the Lord was upon the city (with) a great panic, and He smote the people of the city, both young and old, and hemorrhoids broke out in their hidden parts.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And they sent away the Ark of God to Ekron, and it was that when the Ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought around the Ark of the God of Israel to me to kill me and my people.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the Ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill me and my people," for there was a panic of death in the entire city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the people who did not die, were smitten with hemorrhoids, and the cry of the city ascended to heaven.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And the Ark of the Lord was in the field of the Philistines seven months.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Philistines called the priests and the diviners, saying, "What shall we do to the Ark of the Lord? Let us know in what (manner) we shall send it to its place."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And they said, "If you send the Ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but you shall send back with it a guilt-offering. Then you will be cured, and it will be known to you, why His hand would not turn away from you.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they said, "What is the guilt-offering which we shall send back to Him?" And they said, "The number of the lords of the Philistines: five hemorrhoids of gold and five mice of gold, for there is one plague for all of them and for your lords.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And you shall make the images of your hemorrhoids and the images of your mice who destroy the land, and you shall give honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from upon you, and from upon your god, and from upon your land.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And why should you make your heart heavy as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their hearts heavy? Will it not be, just as He mocked them, and they sent them away, and they departed?</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And now take (wood) and make one new cart, and (take) two milch cows, upon which no yoke has (ever) come, and you shall hitch the cows to the cart, and return their young home from behind them.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And you shall take the Ark of the Lord, and you shall place it on the cart, and the golden objects which you have sent back to Him as a guilt-offering, you shall place in the box at its side, and you shall send it away, and it will go.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And you will see, if it goes up on the way to its own boundary, to Beth-shemesh, He wrought upon us this great evil, and if not, then we shall know that it was not His hand which touched us; it was an accident which befell us.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the men did so, and they took two milch cows, and hitched them to the cart, and their young they shut up in the house.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they placed the Ark of the Lord on the cart, and (also) the box, and the golden mice, and the images of their hemorrhoids.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the cows went straight in the road on the way to Beth-shemesh, on one highway, lowing as they went, and they turned neither to the right nor to the left. And the lords of the Philistines were going along after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now (the inhabitants of) Beth-shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley, and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the Ark, and they rejoiced to see (it).</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the cart had come to the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemeshite, and stood there, and there was a huge stone. And they split the wood, and the cows, they offered up as a burnt offering to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord, and the box which was with it, wherein were the golden objects, and they placed them on the huge stone, and the men of Beth-shemesh offered up burnt offerings and slaughtered sacrifices on that day, to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the five lords of the Philistines had seen, and they returned to Ekron on that day.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And these were the golden hemorrhoids which the Philistines had sent back (as) a guilt-offering to the Lord: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, (and) one for Ekron.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the golden mice were according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, which belonged to the five lords, from fortified city to open village and even to the great stone upon which they had placed the Ark of the Lord, (which is) until this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And He smote of the people of Beth-shemesh, for they had gazed upon the Ark of the Lord, and He smote of the people seventy men, fifty thousand men, and the people mourned, for the Lord had struck a great blow upon the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the men of Beth-shemesh said, "Who will be able to stand before (the Ark of) the Lord, this holy God? and to whom will it go up from upon us?"</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the Ark of the Lord.

Now, let us go there; perhaps he will tell us our way upon which we have gone."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Saul said to his servant, "And behold, if we go what shall we bring to the man, for the bread is used up from our vessels, and there is no present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The lad answered Saul again, and said, "Behold, I have in my possession a fourth of a shekel of silver, and I shall give it to the man of God, that he may tell us our way."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Formerly, in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say thus, "Come and let us go to the seer," for he who is called a prophet today, was formerly called a seer.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Saul said to his servant, "Well said, come, let us go." And they went to the city where the man of God was.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">As they were going up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens coming out to draw water, and they said to them, "Is the seer here?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they answered them and said, "He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for today he has come to the city, for the people will have the sacrifice of the day in the high place.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">When you come to the city, straightway you will find him, before he ascends the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, for he will bless the sacrifice, and afterwards the invited guests will eat. Now go up, for at this time, you will find him.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And they went up to the city. As they were coming into the midst of the city, and behold, Samuel was coming out toward them, to ascend the high place.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now, the Lord had revealed to Samuel one day before Saul's coming, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="16">"At this time tomorrow, I shall send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be a ruler of my people Israel, and he will save My people from the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon My people, for their cry has come to Me."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Samuel saw Saul, and the Lord said to him, "Behold, the man about whom I said to you, 'This one will rule over My people.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Saul approached Samuel inside the gate, and said. "Tell me now, which is the house of the seer?"</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Samuel answered Saul, and said, "I am the seer, and you shall eat with me today, and I shall send you away in the morning, and all that is on your mind, I shall tell you.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And concerning the she-asses which are lost to you, (and you have sought them as of) today, three days, do not take them to heart, for they have been found; and to whom does all that is desirable in Israel belong? Is it not to you and to your father's house?</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Saul answered and said, "Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of Benjamin? Now, why have you spoken to me after this manner?</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the chamber, and he gave them a place at the head of the invited guests, who were about thirty men.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Samuel said to the cook, "Give the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, 'Keep it with you.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the cook raised up the thigh and that which was upon it, and placed it before Saul, whereupon he said, "Behold that which has been reserved! Place (it) before you (and) eat, because for the appointed time it is reserved for you, by saying, 'I have invited the people.' " So Saul ate with Samuel on that day.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they descended from the high place to the city, and he spoke with Saul on the roof.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And they arose early, and it was at dawn, that Samuel called Saul to the roof, saying, "Arise and I shall escort you." And Saul arose, and they went out, both of them, he and Samuel, into the street.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go ahead of us," and he went ahead. "And you, stand still at this time, and I shall let you hear the word of God."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="10"><pasuk id="1">And Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him.

Seven days shall you wait until I come to you, and I shall let you know what you shall do."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it was, when he turned his shoulder to go away from Samuel, that God gave him another heart, and all these signs came about on that day.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And they came there to the hill, and behold, a band of prophets (came) toward him, and the spirit of God passed upon him, and he prophesied in their midst.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it was, that all who had known him before, saw that behold, he was prophesying with the prophets. And the people said to one another, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And a man from there, answered and said, "And who was their father?" It, therefore became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he finished prophesying and came to the high place.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said, "To seek the she-asses. And when we saw that they were not (to be found), we came to Samuel."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Saul's uncle said, "Now tell me what Samuel said to you."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Saul said to his uncle, "He told us that the she-asses had been found," and the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Samuel called the people together unto God to Mizpah.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he said to the children of Israel, "So said the Lord, God of Israel, 'I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kingdoms which oppressed you.'</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And today you have rejected your God, Who saves you from all your adversities and your troubles, and you have said to Him, 'But, a king You shall set over us.' And now, stand before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near, by its families, and the family of the Matrites was taken, and Saul, the son of Kish, was taken. And they sought him, but he was not found.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they asked of the Lord further, "Has the man come here yet?" And the Lord said, "Behold, he is hidden among the baggage."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And they ran and took him from there, and he stood in the midst of the people, and he was taller than all the people from his shoulder and upward.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Samuel said to all the people, "Have you seen (the one) whom the Lord has chosen, for there is none like him among all the people?" And all the people shouted and said, "Long live the king!"</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and he wrote (it) in a book, and placed (it) before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his house.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Saul too went to his house to Gibeah, and the band whose heart God had touched, went with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And unscrupulous men said, "How will this one save us?"

And Jonathan said to his weapon- bearer, "Come up after me, for the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, with his weapon-bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan, and his weapon-bearer was slaying after him.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his weapon-bearer made, was about twenty men, in about half a furrow (which) a yoke (of oxen plow in) a field.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And there was a trembling in the camp and the field, and among the people; the garrison and the raiders also trembled, and the earth quaked and became a trembling inspired by God.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Saul's lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin, and behold the multitude was wandering, and it was coming closer.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Saul said to the people who were with him, "Inspect now, and see who is gone from among us." And they inspected, and behold, Jonathan and his weapon-bearer were not there.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Saul said to Ahiah, "Bring near the Ark of God," for the Ark of God was on that day with the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And it was, while Saul still spoke to the priest, that the tumult which was in the camp of the Philistines was continuously increasing, and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Saul and all the people who were with him, gathered, and came to the battle, and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, (because there was) a very great confusion.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the Hebrews (who) were with the Philistines as previously, who went up with them in the camp round about, they too (turned) to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And all the people who were hiding in Mt. Ephraim, heard that the Philistines had fled, and they too pursued closely behind them in the battle.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the Lord saved Israel on that day, and the battle passed Beth-aven.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, and Saul adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who will eat food until evening, until I shall be avenged of my enemies," and none of the people tasted any food.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And all (the people of) the land came in the forest, and there was honey on the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the people came into the forest, and behold, a flow of honey, but no one put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">But Jonathan had not heard when his father had adjured the people, and he extended the end of the staff which was in his hand, and dipped it into the honeycomb, and when he brought back his hand to his mouth, his eyes brightened.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And one man of the people called out and said, "Your father adjured the people, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food today,' and the people have become faint."</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Jonathan said, "My father has perturbed the land. See now that my eyes have brightened, for I have tasted a little of this honey.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">How much more, if the people had eaten today of the spoils of their enemies, which they found, would there not now have been a greater slaughter among the Philistines?"</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And they smote the Philistines that day, from Michmash to Ajalon, and the people became very faint.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And the people flew to the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and they slaughtered on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And they told Saul, saying, "Behold, the people are sinning against the Lord, by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have transgressed; roll a huge stone to me this day."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And Saul said, "Disperse among the people, and you shall say to them, 'Bring near to me each man his ox and each man his lamb, and you shall slaughter here, and you shall eat, and you shall not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood.' " And all the people brought near, each man his ox and his lamb that night, and they slaughtered there.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And Saul built an altar to the Lord; with that one he started to build an altar to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines at night, and plunder among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man among them. " And they said, "Do all that is good in your eyes." Whereupon the priest said, "Let us draw near here to God."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Saul asked of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But He did not answer him on that day.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Saul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see wherein was this sin today.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">For as the Lord lives, who saves Israel, for though it be in Jonathan my son, he will die," and there was no one who answered him from among all the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And he said to all Israel, "You will be to one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be to one side." And the people answered Saul, "Do what is good in your eyes."</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And Saul said to the Lord God of Israel, "Give a perfect lot," whereupon Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son;" and Jonathan was taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me; what have you done?" And Jonathan told him and said, "I but tasted a bit of honey with the end of the staff which is in my hand. Here I am; let me die."</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And Saul said, "So shall God do, and so shall He continue; for you shall die, Jonathan."</pasuk><pasuk id="45">And the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel, die? Far be it. As the Lord lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." And the people redeemed Jonathan, and he did not die.</pasuk><pasuk id="46">And Saul went up from (pursuing) after the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their place.</pasuk><pasuk id="47">And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and he waged war against his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines, and wherever he would turn, he would cause them to tremble.</pasuk><pasuk id="48">And he gathered an army, and he smote Amalek, and he saved Israel from the hand of its plunderer.</pasuk><pasuk id="49">And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his daughters, the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger was Michal.</pasuk><pasuk id="50">And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the commander of his army was Abiner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</pasuk><pasuk id="51">And Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel.</pasuk><pasuk id="52">And the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul; when Saul saw any valiant man or any soldierly man, he would bring him in to himself.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="15"><pasuk id="1">And Samuel said to Saul, "The Lord sent me to anoint you to be king over His people, over Israel; and now hearken to the voice of the words of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">So said the Lord of Hosts, 'I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid (wait) for him on the way, when he came up out of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Now, go, and you shall smite Amalek, and you shall utterly destroy all that is his, and you shall not have pity on him: and you shall slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Saul called the people together, and he counted them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand, the men of Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Saul came as far as the city of Amalek, and he fought in the valley.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Saul said to the Kenite, "Turn away and go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, and you did kindness with all the children of Israel, when they went up out of Egypt." And the Kenites turned away from amidst Amalek.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Saul smote Amalek, from Havilah until you come to Shur, which is in front of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he seized Agag, the king of Amalek, alive; and he completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Saul and the people had pity on Agag, and on the best of the sheep and the cattle, and the fatlings, and on the fattened sheep, and on all that was good; and they did not want to destroy them; but everything which was vile and feeble, that they utterly destroyed.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="11">"I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me, and he has not fulfilled My words." And it distressed Samuel, and he cried out to the Lord all night.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Samuel arose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was told to Samuel, saying, "Saul has come to Carmel, and behold, he is setting up a place for himself, and he passed and went down to Gilgal."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "May you be blessed of the Lord; I have fulfilled the word of the Lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears? And the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Saul said, "They brought them from the Amalekites, for the people had pity on the best of the sheep, and the oxen, in order to sacrifice to the Lord your God: and the rest we have utterly destroyed."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Samuel said to Saul, "Desist, and I shall tell you what the Lord spoke to me last night." And he said to him, "Speak."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Samuel said, "Even if you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you as king over Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the Lord sent you on a mission, and said, 'Go, and you shall utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and you shall wage war against them until they destroy them.'</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now, why did you not hearken to the voice of the Lord, but you flew upon the spoil, and you did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord?"</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Saul said to Samuel, "Yes, I did hearken to the voice of the Lord. I did go on the mission on which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag, the king of Amalek alive, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the people took from the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the ban, to sacrifice to your God in Gilgal."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Samuel said, "Has the Lord (as much) desire in burnt offerings and peace-offerings, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than a peace-offering; to hearken (is better) than the fat of rams.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Since you rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you from being a king."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned, for I transgressed the Lord's command, and your words, for I feared the people, and I hearkened to their voice.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And now, forgive now my sin, and return with me, and I shall prostrate myself to the Lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Samuel said to Saul, "I shall not return with you, for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being a king over Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Samuel turned to go, and he seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Samuel said to him, "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you, today; and has given it to your fellow who is better than you.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And also, the Strength of Israel will neither lie nor repent, for He is not a man to repent."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And he said, "I have sinned.

And Agag went to him delicately. And Agag said, "Surely, the bitterness of death has turned."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And Samuel said, "As your sword bereaved women, so will your mother be bereaved among women."

For, if Saul hears, he will kill me." And the Lord said, "You shall take a heifer with you, and you shall say, 'I have come to slaughter (a sacrifice) to the Lord.'</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And you shall invite Jesse to the sacrificial feast, and I shall let you know what you shall do, and you shall anoint for Me whom I shall tell you."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Samuel did that which the Lord had spoken, and he came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city hurried toward him, and one said, "Is your coming peaceable?"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he said, "Peaceable.

And what more can he have, but the kingdom?"</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Saul eyed David from that day on.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And it was on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God rested upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, and David was playing with his hand like everyday, and the spear was in Saul's hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Saul cast the spear, and said, "I shall pin David to the wall," and David turned from before him twice.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Saul feared David, for the Lord was with him, while He had turned away from Saul.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Saul removed him from (being) with him, and made him for himself a captain over a thousand, and he went out and came in before the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And David was successful in all his ways; and the Lord was with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Saul saw that he was very successful, and he feared him.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Saul said to David, "Behold, my elder daughter, Merab. I shall give her to you as a wife. But, be a warrior for me, and wage the wars of the Lord." For Saul said, "Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my life, or my fathers family in Israel, that I should be a son-in-law to the King."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And it was at the time that Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel, the Meholathite, as a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Saul said, "I shall give her to him, and she will be a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines will be upon him." And Saul said to David, "With (one of) two, shall you be my son-in-law today."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king desires you, and all his servants love you; and now, become the king's son-in-law.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Saul's servants spoke these words in David's ears. And David said, "Does becoming the king's son-in-law, seem to you to be a light thing, for I am poor and lightly esteemed?"</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Saul's servants told him, saying, "According to these words, has David spoken."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Saul said, "So shall you say to David, 'The king has no desire in a dowry, but in one hundred foreskins of Philistines, to avenge himself upon the king's enemies.' " But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And his servants told David these words, and the thing pleased David to become the king's son-in-law, and the days had not expired.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And David arose, and he and his men went, and he slew two hundred men of the Philistines, and brought their foreskins, and they delivered them in full to the king, in order to become the king's son-in-law. And the king gave him Michal, his daughter, as a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Saul saw, and knew that the Lord was with David, and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Saul grew still more afraid of David, and Saul was hostile to David all the days.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And the princes of the Philistines came out, and it was, as often as they came out, that David was more successful than all Saul's servants, and his name was highly esteemed.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="19"><pasuk id="1">And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's son, desired David very much.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Jonathan told David, saying, "Saul, my father, seeks to put you to death, and now, beware now in the morning, and you shall remain in secret, and hide.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And I shall come out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I shall speak on your behalf to my father; and if I see something, I shall tell you."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul, his father, and he said to him, "Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds are very good toward you.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he put his life in his hand and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel. You saw and rejoiced. Why, then, should you sin against innocent blood, to put David to death for no reason?"</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Saul listened to Jonathan's voice, and Saul swore, "As the Lord lives, he will not be put to death."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was before him as yesterday and before.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And there was war again, and David went out and battled the Philistines, and dealt a great blow upon them, and they fled from before him.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And an evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, and he was sitting in his house, with his spear in his hand, and David was playing with his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Saul attempted to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from before Saul, and Saul drove the spear into the wall, but David fled and escaped on that night.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Saul sent messengers to David's house to guard him and to put him to death in the morning, and Michal his wife told David, saying, "If you do not flee for your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death!"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Michal let David down through the window, and he fled and escaped.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Michal took the teraphim, and put them into the bed, and she put a goatskin at its head, and covered it with a garment.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Saul sent messengers to take David, and she said, "He is ill."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the messengers came, and behold, the teraphim was in the bed, and the goatskin was at its head.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Saul said to Michal, "Why have you thus deceived me, and you sent away my enemy, so that he escaped?" And Michal said to Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go. Why should I put you to death?' "</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Now David had fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him, and he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And it was related to Saul, saying, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Saul sent messengers to take David, and he saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel was standing as head over them; and a spirit from God was upon Saul's messengers, and they too prophesied.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they too prophesied. And Saul continued to send third messengers, and they too prophesied.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And he also went to Ramah, and he came to the great pit which is in Secu, and he asked, and said, "Where are Samuel and David?" And (one) said, "Behold, at Naioth in Ramah."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And he went there, to Naioth in Ramah, and even upon him was a spirit from God, and he went along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel, and he fell naked all that day and all the night. Therefore, they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="20"><pasuk id="1">And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and he came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my transgression and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he said to him, "Far be it. You shall not die. My father will do nothing, either great or small, that he will not reveal to me. And why should my father conceal this thing from me? It is not (true.)"</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And David swore further, and said, "Your father knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he said, 'Let not Jonathan know this, lest he become saddened.' But, indeed, as the Lord lives, and by the life of your soul, there is but a step between me and death."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Jonathan said to David, "What your soul will say, I shall do for you."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I am accustomed to sit with the king, to eat. And you shall let me go, that I may hide in the field until the evening of the third day.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">If your father is mindful of me, you shall say, 'David took leave of me to hasten home to Bethlehem, his city, for it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.'</pasuk><pasuk id="7">If he says thus, 'Good,' then it is well with your bondsman, but if he becomes angry, know that the evil has been decided upon by him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And you shall do kindness with your bondsman, for into the covenant of the Lord, have you brought your bondsman with you, and if there be guilt in me, put me to death yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?"</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Jonathan said, "Far be it from you. For if I know that the evil has been decided upon by my father to come upon you, would I not tell you that?"</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me, or what your father will answer you harshly?"</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out to the field." And both of them went out to the field.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Jonathan said to David, "(By) the Lord God of Israel, that I shall sound out my father at this time on the third morrow, and behold, if it is good for David, will I not send for you then, and reveal it to you?</pasuk><pasuk id="13">So shall the Lord do to Jonathan and more also, if it pleases my father to (bring) evil upon you, I shall reveal it to you, and I shall send you away, that you may go in peace, and may the Lord be with you as He was with my father.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And I shall not ask of you if I am still alive, will you not do kindness of the Lord with me, that I die not?</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And you shall not discontinue your kindness from my household forever, and not even when the Lord cuts off David's enemies, each man from upon the face of the earth."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, "And may the Lord demand it from the hand of David's enemies."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Jonathan continued to make David swear, in his love for him, for he loved him the love of his soul.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be remembered, for your seat will be vacant.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And for three days, you shall hide very well, and you shall come to the place where you hid on the day of work, and you shall stay beside the traveler's stone.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And I shall shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a mark.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And behold, I shall send the youth, (saying,) 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the youth, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you,' take it and come, for it is well with you, and there is nothing the matter, as the Lord lives.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">But, if I say thus to the youth, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' go! For the Lord has sent you away.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And (concerning) the matter which we have spoken, I and you, behold, the Lord is between me and you forever."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And David hid in the field, and when it was the new moon, Saul sat down to the meal to eat.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall, and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat down beside Saul, and David's place was vacant.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Saul did not say anything on that day, for he thought, "It is an incident; he is not clean, for he is not clean."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And it was, on the morrow of the new moon, the second (day of the month), that David's place was vacant, and Saul said to Jonathan, his son, "Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today?"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Jonathan answered Saul, "David asked leave of me (to go) to Bethlehem.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And he said, 'Let me go away now, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and he, my brother, commanded me, and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me slip away now, and see my brothers. ' He, therefore, did not come to the king's table."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And Saul's wrath was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a straying woman deserving of punishment! Did I not know that you choose the son of Jesse, to your shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</pasuk><pasuk id="31">For all the days that the son of Jesse is living on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. And now, send and take him to me, for he is condemned to death."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And Saul cast the spear upon him to strike him; and Jonathan knew that it had been decided upon by his father, to put David to death.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger; and he did not eat any food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved concerning David, for his father had put him to shame.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And it was in the morning, that Jonathan went out at David's appointed time, and a small boy was with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And he said to his boy, "Run, find now the arrows which I shoot." The boy ran; and he shot the arrow to cause it to go beyond him.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And the lad came up to the place of the arrow, which Jonathan had shot. And Jonathan called after the lad, and said, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Jonathan called after the lad, "Quickly, hasten, do not stand!" And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, "Go, bring (them) to the city."</pasuk><pasuk id="41">The lad departed, and David arose from (a place) toward the south; and he fell upon his face to the ground three times, and prostrated himself three times. And they kissed one another, and wept one with the other, until David exceeded.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace! (And bear in mind) that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, 'May the Lord be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.' "</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="21"><pasuk id="1">And he arose and went away; and Jonathan came to the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest, and Ahimelech came trembling toward David, and said, "Why are you alone, and no one with you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a matter, and said to me, 'Let no man know anything concerning the matter upon which I am sending you, and with which I have charged you.' And I troubled the young men (to advance) to a hidden, secret place.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And now, what is there in your possession? Five loaves of bread? Give them into my hand, or whatever is found."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the priest answered David, and said, "There is no ordinary bread in my possession, but there is holy bread, if the young men have but kept themselves from women."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And David answered the priest, and said to him, "But, women are withheld from us as of yesterday and the day before yesterday when I left, and the young men's garments are hallowed, and that is in a manner common, and even if today it would be hallowed in the vessel."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the priest gave him hallowed (bread), for there was no bread there, except the showbread, which was removed from before the Lord, to place warm bread on the day it was taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And there was a man of Saul's servants on that day, detained before the Lord: and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David said to Ahimelech, "And if there is here in your possession a spear or a sword, for neither my sword nor my weapons have I taken in my hand, for the king's business was urgent."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of the terebinth, behold, it is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that for yourself, take it, for there is none besides it here." And David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And David arose, and fled on that day from before Saul; and he came to Achish the king of Gath.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the bondsmen of Achish said to him, "Is this not David, the king of the land? Was it not of this one that they would sing out with musical instruments, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?' "</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And David took these words to heart, and became very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he changed his speech before their eyes, and he feigned insanity before them. And he scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down upon his beard.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Achish said to his bondsmen, "Behold, you see a man who is mad. Why do you bring him to me?</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Do I lack lunatics, that you have brought this one to rave in my presence? Will this one come into my house?"</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="22"><pasuk id="1">And David went away from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And his brothers and all his father's household heard, and went down to him there.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And every man who was in distress, and every man who had a creditor, and every man of embittered spirit, gathered themselves to him, and he became a chief over them; and there were about four hundred men with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And David went from there to Mizpeh Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, "Let my father and mother come out now with you, until I know what God will do for me."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Gad the prophet said to David, "You shall not stay in the stronghold. Go and enter the land of Judah." And David went, and came to the forest of Hereth.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had become known, and Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on a hill, and his spear was in his hand, and all his servants were standing by him.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Saul said to his servants who were standing by him, "Hearken now, O Benjamites, will the son of Jesse also give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he appoint all of you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds?</pasuk><pasuk id="8">For all of you have rebelled against me, and no one reveals to me when my son made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and no one of you feels sorry for me, or reveals to me that my son has incited my servant to rise up against me, to lie in wait as of this day."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Then Doeg the Edomite, who was appointed over Saul's servants, answered and said, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And he inquired of the Lord on his behalf, and gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the king sent to call Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, the priest, and all of his father's household, the priests who were in Nob; and they all came to the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Saul said, "Listen now, O son of Ahitub." And he said, "Here I am, my lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Saul said to him, "Why have you rebelled against me, you and the son of Jesse, by your giving him food and a sword, and by inquiring of God on his behalf, to rise up against me as one who lies in wait as of this day?"</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Ahimelech answered the king, and said, "Now, who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and who goes to do your service, and is honored in your house?</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Have I begun today to inquire of God on his behalf? Far be it from me. Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to all my father's household, for your servant knew nothing of all this, less, or more."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the king said, "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's household."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the king said to the footmen who were standing beside him, "Turn and put the priests of the Lord to death, for their hand is also with David, and because they knew that he was fleeing, and they did not inform me." And the king's servants would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the king said to Doeg, "You turn, and fall upon the priests." And Doeg turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty-five men, wearers of the linen ephod.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the sharp edge of the sword, both man and woman, infant and suckling, and ox and ass, and lamb, with the sharp edge of the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And one son of Ahimelech, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, (and) that he would tell Saul.

And the Lord said to David, "Go, and you shall smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah, to the battle array of the Philistines?"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And David continued further to inquire of the Lord, and the Lord answered him and said, "Arise, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And David and his men went to Keilah, and battled the Philistines, and he led away their cattle, and struck them a great blow, and David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And it was that when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David, to Keilah, the ephod came down in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it was related to Saul that David had come to Keilah, and Saul said, "God has delivered him into my hand, for he has been shut in by coming into a city with doors and bars."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David knew that upon him, Saul was plotting the evil; and he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring near the ephod."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And David said, "O Lord God of Israel, Your bondsman has heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your bondsman has heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell now Your bondsman!"

And the Lord said, "They will deliver."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And David and his men, about six hundred men, arose and left Keilah, and they went wherever they would go, and it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, and he refrained from going forth.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And David dwelt in the desert, in the strongholds, and he dwelt in the mountain in the Desert of Ziph, and Saul sought him all the days, but God did not deliver him into his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And David saw that Saul had gone forth to seek his soul, and David was in the Desert of Ziph, in the forest.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David to the forest, and he strengthened his hand through God.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he said to him, "Fear not, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you, and you shall reign over Israel, and may I be to you as a viceroy, and my father Saul too, knows (that this is) so."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the two of them made a covenant before the Lord; and David stayed in the forest, and Jonathan went to his home.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the Ziphites went up to Saul, to Gibeah, saying, "Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds, in the forest, in the hill of Hachilah, which is from the south of the Desolate Wasteland?</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And now, according to all the desires of your heart to come down, come down, and it is incumbent upon us to deliver him into the king's hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Saul said, "Blessed shall you be to the Lord, for you have taken pity upon me.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Go now, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his foot will be. Who saw him there? for (one) told me that he deals cunningly.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And see and know of all the hiding places where he hides, and you shall return to me with the certainty, and I shall go with you, and it shall be that if he is in the land, I shall search him out among the thousands of Judah."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul, and David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the plain which is to the south of the Desolate Wasteland.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Saul and his men went to search, and they told David, and he went down to the rock, and stayed in the Desert of Maon, and Saul heard and pursued David in the Desert of Maon.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Saul went from this side of the mountain, and David and his men were on that side of the mountain; and David was hastening to get away from before Saul, but Saul and his men were encircling to David and his men, to seize them.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Make haste and go, for the Philistines have spread out over the land!"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Saul returned from pursuing David, and he went toward the Philistines. Therefore, they called that place the Rock of the Divisions.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="24"><pasuk id="1">And David went up from there, and he stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And it was, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that they told him, saying, "David is in the Desert of En-gedi."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Saul took three thousand picked men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he came to the sheepcotes on the way, and there was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet, while David and his men were staying at the end of the cave.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And David's men said to him, "Behold the day concerning which the Lord said to you, 'Behold, I shall deliver your enemy into your hand; and you shall do to him as it will seem good in your eyes.' " And David arose, and secretly severed the skirt of Saul's coat.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And it was afterwards, that David's heart smote him, for he had severed Saul's skirt.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he said to his men, "The Lord forbid it for me, that I should do this thing to my lord, to the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth my hand upon him, for he is the Lord's anointed."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And David stayed his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise up against Saul, and Saul arose from the cave and went on the way.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David arose afterwards and emerged from the cave after Saul, saying, "My lord the King!" And Saul looked behind him, and David bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And David said to Saul, "Why should you listen to the words of a man, saying, 'Behold, David seeks your harm'?</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the Lord delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and (one) said to kill you, but (my soul) had pity on you, and I said, 'I shall not stretch forth my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.'</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Father, see! Also, see the skirt of your coat in my hand, for in that I severed the skirt of your coat and I did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, but you are stalking my soul to take it.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">May the Lord judge between me and you, and may the Lord avenge me of you, but my hand shall not be upon you.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">As says the proverb of the ancient one; 'From the wicked comes forth wickedness,' and my hand shall not be upon you.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">After whom has the king of Israel come forth?

And Saul raised his voice and wept.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me with goodness, while I have repaid you with evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And you have shown today how you have dealt well with me, how the Lord delivered me into your hand, and you did not kill me.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him away safely? And may the Lord repay you with goodness for what you have done to me on this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And now, behold, I know that you will reign, and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And now, swear to me by the Lord, that you will not cut off my seed, and you will not destroy my name from my father's house."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And David swore to Saul; and Saul went to his home, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="25"><pasuk id="1">And Samuel died, and all Israel gathered, and lamented him, and they buried him in his house in Ramah.

And the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep and one thousand goats; and he was, while shearing his sheep, in Carmel.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. And the woman was of good sense and of beautiful form, but the man was hard, and of evil deeds; and he was a Calebite.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And David heard in the desert, that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And David sent ten youths, and David said to the youths, "Go up to Carmel, and you shall come to Nabal, and greet him in my name.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And you shall say, 'So shall you be living next year, and may peace be to you, and peace to your household, and peace to all that is yours.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And now, I have heard that they are shearing for you. Now, your shepherds were with us. We did not disgrace them, neither was anything missing to them all the time they were in Carmel.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Ask your youths and they will tell you, and may the youths find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. Give now, what your hand will find, for your servants and for your son David.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David's youths came, and spoke to Nabal according to all these words, in David's name, and they rested.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, "Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays, there are many slaves, who break away, each one from his master.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Now, shall I take my bread and my water, and my meal which I have cooked for my shearers, and shall I give them to people of whom I know not whence they are?"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And David's youths turned around to their way, and returned, and told him according to all these words.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And David said to his men, "Gird each man his sword," and they girded each man his sword, and David too, girded his sword, and they went up after David, about four hundred men, and two hundred stayed with the luggage.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And one youth of the youths, told Abigail, the wife of Nabal, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master, and he drove them away.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the men are very good to us; and we were not disgraced, nor was anything missing to us all the time we went with them, when we were in the field.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">They were a wall over us both night and day, all the time we were with them, pasturing the sheep.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And now, know and see what you will do, for the evil has been decided upon against our master and against all of his household; and he is such a base person that one cannot speak to him."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Abigail hastened and she took two hundred loaves, and two earthenware jugs of wine, and five prepared sheep, and five seah of flour of roasted ears of grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs; and she placed them on the donkeys.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And she said to her youths, "Go on ahead of me. Behold, I am coming after you." And she did not tell her husband Nabal.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And it was, that she was riding on the donkey, and coming down, under cover of the mountain, and behold, David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And David said, "Surely in vain have I watched all this fellow has in the desert, so that nothing was missing of all that is his, and he has returned me evil for good.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">So shall God do to David's enemies, and so shall He continue, if I leave over of all that he has, by the morning light, even one dog."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Abigail saw David, and she hastened and leaned off the donkey; and she fell on her face before David, and prostrated herself on the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And she fell at his feet, and said, "In me alone, my lord, is the iniquity. Now, let your handmaid speak into your ears, and hearken to the words of your handmaid.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Let not my lord take heed of this base fellow, of Nabal, for like his name, so is he. Nabal is his name, and ungratefulness is with him: and I, your handmaid, did not see my lord's youths whom you sent.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And now, my lord, as the Lord lives and by your life, (I swear) that the Lord has withheld you from coming to bloodshed, and from saving yourself with your hand. And now, may your enemies and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And now, this gift which your handmaid has brought to my lord, shall be given to the youths who walk at my lord's feet.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Forgive now your handmaid's transgression, for the Lord shall make for my lord a sure house, for my lord fights the wars of the Lord. And let no evil be found in you all your days.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And a man has arisen to pursue you and to seek your soul. But my lord's soul shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord your God, while the soul of your enemies, the Lord will sling it with the hollow of the sling.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And it will be, when the Lord will do to my lord according to all the good which He spoke concerning you, and He will appoint you as ruler over Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">Let this not be to you as a stumblingblock and a remorse of heart to my lord, that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when the Lord will do good to my lord, you shall remember your maidservant."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And David said to Abigail, "Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, Who has sent you towards me on this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Blessed is your advice, and blessed be you, who have restrained me this day from coming into bloodshed, and from avenging myself with my own hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And indeed, as the Lord God of Israel lives, Who has restrained me from harming you, (I swear) that had you not hastened and come toward me, there would not have been left to Nabal until daybreak, even one dog."</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And David took from her hand that which she had brought him, and he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. See that I have hearkened to your voice and have shown you favor."</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he had a feast in his house like the feast of the king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, and he was very drunk. And she did not tell him anything, less or more until daybreak.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And it was in the morning, when the wine had left Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became like stone.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And it was just ten days after, that the Lord inflicted a stroke on Nabal, and he died.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And David heard that Nabal had died, and he said, "Blessed is the Lord, Who has judged the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and restrained His bondsman from evil, and returned Nabal's evil upon his own head." And David sent, and spoke concerning Abigail to take her to him for a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And David's servants came to Abigail, to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, "David has sent us to you to take you to him for a wife."</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And she arose, and prostrated herself upon her face to the ground, and said, "Behold, your bondswoman is a slave to wash the feet of my lord's servants."</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And she hastened, and mounted the donkey with her five maidens who went with her. And she went after David's messengers, and became his wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And David took Ahinoam from Jezreel, and they both became his wives.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And Saul had given his daughter, Michal, wife of David, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="26"><pasuk id="1">And the Ziphites came to Saul, to Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding in the Hill of Hachilah, before the Desolate Wasteland?"</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Saul arose and descended to the Desert of Ziph, and with him were three thousand picked men, to seek David in the Desert of Ziph.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Saul encamped in the Hill of Hachilah, which is before the Desolate Wasteland, by the road. And David was staying in the desert; and it appeared to him that Saul had come after him to the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And David sent spies, and he learned that Saul had surely come.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. And Saul was lying within the barricade, and the people were encamped around him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And David spoke up and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?" And Abishai said, "I shall go down with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul was lying asleep within the barricade with his spear thrust into the ground at his head, and Abner and the people were lying around him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Abishai said to David, "Today, God has delivered your enemy into your hand; and now, let me strike him now, with the spear to the ground with one stroke; and I shall not repeat this to him."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him, for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and be accounted guiltless?"</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And David said, "As the Lord lives, but the Lord will smite him, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down to war and perish.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Far be it for me from the Lord to stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed. And now, take now the spear which is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go away."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And David took the spear and the jug of water from near Saul's head, and they went away. And no one saw and no one knew and no one awakened, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And David crossed to the other side, and stood on the mountain peak from afar; the space between them was great.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Will you not answer, Abner?" And Abner answered and said, "Who are you who have called to the king?"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And David said to Abner, "Are you not a valiant man? and who is like you in Israel? and why did you not guard your lord the king? for one of the people came to destroy the king, your lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">This thing which you have done, is not good; as the Lord lives, you are worthy of death, for you did not keep watch over your lord, over the Lord's anointed. And now, see where the king's spear is, and the jug of water which was at his head."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Saul recognized David's voice, and said, "Is this your voice, my son David," And David said, "(It is) my voice, my lord, O king."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he said, "Why does my lord pursue his servant? for what have I done? and what evil is in my hand?</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And now, let now my lord the king hear his servant's words. If the Lord has incited you against me, He will accept an offering; but if the sons of men, cursed be they before the Lord, for they have driven me today from cleaving to the Lord's heritage, saying, 'Go, worship other gods.'</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And now, let not my blood fall to the ground away from the face of the Lord, for the king of Israel has gone out to seek a flea as the partridge hunts in the mountains."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I shall harm you no more, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And David answered and said, "Behold the king's spear. Now let one of the youths come over and take it.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the Lord will repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the Lord delivered you today into my hand, and I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And behold, as your life was precious this day in my eyes, so shall my life be precious in the eyes of the Lord, and He shall save me from every distress."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Saul said to David, "Blessed be you, my son David. You shall both do (great things) and you shall prevail."

And he and the six hundred men who were with him, crossed over to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And David dwelt with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each man and his household, David and his two wives; Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the wife of Nabal, the Carmelitess.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath, and he did not continue to search for him.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And David said to Achish, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the country towns, and I shall dwell there, for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Achish gave him Ziklag on that day; therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the number of days which David dwelt in the field of the Philistines was (some) days and four months.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And David and his men would go up and raid the Geshurites and the Gizrites and the Amalekites, for those (tribes) were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And David would smite (the inhabitants of) the land, and leave neither man nor woman alive; and he would take sheep and cattle, and donkeys and camels and clothing, and return and come to Achish.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Achish would say, "Where did you raid today?"

And Achish said to David, "Therefore, I shall make you my bodyguard all the time."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Now Samuel had died, and all Israel lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, and (each one lamented him) in his own city. Now, Saul had abolished necromancers and those who divine with the Jidoa bone from the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the Philistines gathered, and came and encamped in Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines.
