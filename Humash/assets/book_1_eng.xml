And he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I made him a master over you, and I gave him all his brothers as servants, and I have sustained him with corn and wine; so for you then, what shall I do, my son?"</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Esau said to his father, "Have you [but] one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father." And Esau raised his voice and wept.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And his father Isaac answered and said to him, "Behold, your dwelling place shall be the fat places of the earth and of the dew of the heaven from above.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And you shall live by your sword, and you shall serve your brother, and it will be, when you grieve, that you will break his yoke off your neck."</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, "Let the days of mourning for my father draw near, I will then kill my brother Jacob. "</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And Rebecca was told of the words of Esau, her elder son, and she sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and she said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau regrets [his relationship] to you [and wishes] to kill you.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise, flee to my brother Laban, to Haran.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And you shall dwell with him for a few days until your brother's wrath has subsided.</pasuk><pasuk id="45">Until your brother's rage subsides from you, and he forgets what you did to him, and I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of both of you on one day?"</pasuk><pasuk id="46">And Rebecca said to Isaac, "I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth like these, from the daughters of the land, of what use is life to me?"</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="28"><pasuk id="1">And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and he commanded him and said to him, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Arise, go to Padan aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and take yourself from there a wife of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And may the Almighty God bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and you shall become an assembly of peoples.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Isaac sent Jacob, and he went to Padan aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebecca, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan aram, to take himself a wife from there, and that when he blessed him, he commanded him, saying, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Jacob listened to his father and his mother, and he went to Padan aram.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were displeasing to his father Isaac.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So Esau went to Ishmael, and he took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, the sister of Nebaioth, in addition to his other wives as a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Jacob left Beer sheba, and he went to Haran.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And he arrived at the place and lodged there because the sun had set, and he took some of the stones of the place and placed [them] at his head, and he lay down in that place.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And he dreamed, and behold! a ladder set up on the ground and its top reached to heaven; and behold, angels of God were ascending and descending upon it.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And behold, the Lord was standing over him, and He said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac; the land upon which you are lying to you I will give it and to your seed.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall gain strength westward and eastward and northward and southward; and through you shall be blessed all the families of the earth and through your seed.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And behold, I am with you, and I will guard you wherever you go, and I will restore you to this land, for I will not forsake you until I have done what I have spoken concerning you."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Jacob awakened from his sleep, and he said, "Indeed, the Lord is in this place, and I did not know [it]."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he was frightened, and he said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Jacob arose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had placed at his head, and he set it up as a monument, and he poured oil on top of it.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And he named the place Beth El, but Luz was orignally the name of the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Jacob uttered a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and He will guard me on this way, upon which I am going, and He will give me bread to eat and a garment to wear;</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And if I return in peace to my father's house, and the Lord will be my God;</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Then this stone, which I have placed as a monument, shall be a house of God, and everything that You give me, I will surely tithe to You.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="29"><pasuk id="1">Now Jacob lifted his feet and went to the land of the people of the East.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he looked, and behold! a well in the field, and behold! three flocks of sheep lying beside it, because from that well they would water the flocks, and a huge rock was upon the mouth of the well.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And all the flocks would gather there, and they would roll the rock off the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and [then] they would return the rock onto the mouth of the well, to its place.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Haran."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" And they said, "We know [him]."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he said to them, "[Are things going] well with him?" And they said, "[Things are going] well, and behold, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he said, "The day is yet long; it is not the time to take in the livestock. Water the sheep and go, pasture."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they said, "We cannot [do that], until all the flocks are gathered together, and they will roll the rock off the mouth of the well, and we shall [then] water the sheep."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob drew near and rolled the rock off the mouth of the well, and he watered the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Jacob kissed Rachel, and he raised his voice and wept.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman and that he was Rebecca's son, and she ran and told her father.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now it came to pass when Laban heard the report of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran towards him, and he embraced him, and he kissed him, and he brought him into his house. He told Laban all these happenings.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Laban said to him, "Indeed, you are my bone and my flesh." And so he stayed with him a full month.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my kinsman, should you work for me gratis? Tell me what your wages shall be."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Leah's eyes were tender, but Rachel had beautiful features and a beautiful complexion.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, "I will work for you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than I should give her to another man. Stay with me."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, but they appeared to him like a few days because of his love for her.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are completed, that I may come to her."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">So Laban gathered all the people of the place, and he made a feast.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And it came to pass in the evening that Laban took his daughter Leah, and he brought her to him, and he came to her.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Laban gave Zilpah his maidservant to his daughter Leah as a maidservant.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And it came to pass in the morning, and behold she was Leah! So he said to Laban, "What is this that you have done to me? Did I not work with you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?"</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Laban said, "It is not done so in our place to give the younger one before the firstborn.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Complete the [wedding] week of this one, and we will give you this one too, for the work that you will render me for another seven years."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Jacob did so, and he completed the week of this one, and he gave his daughter Rachel to him as a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Laban gave his daughter Rachel his maidservant Bilhah, for a maidservant.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And he came also to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah; and he worked with him yet another seven years.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, so He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, "Because the Lord has seen my affliction, for now my husband will love me."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, "Since the Lord has heard that I am hated, He gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, "Now this time my husband will be attached to me, for I have borne him three sons; therefore, He named him Levi.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, "This time, I will thank the Lord! Therefore, she named him Judah, and [then] she stopped bearing.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="30"><pasuk id="1">And Rachel saw that she had not borne [any children] to Jacob, and Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Jacob, "Give me children, and if not, I am dead."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Jacob became angry with Rachel, and he said, "Am I instead of God, Who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So she said, "Here is my maidservant Bilhah; come to her, and she will bear [children] on my knees, so that I, too, will be built up from her."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">So she gave him her maidservant Bilhah for a wife, and Jacob came to her.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Bilhah conceived, and she bore Jacob a son.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Rachel said, "God has judged me, and He has also hearkened to my voice and has given me a son"; so she named him Dan.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Rachel said, "[With] divine bonds I have been joined to my sister; I have also prevailed"; so she named him Naftali.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing [children], she took her maidservant Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob for a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, bore Jacob a son.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Leah said, "Luck has come"; so she named him Gad.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, bore Jacob a second son.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Leah said, "Because of my good fortune, for women have declared me fortunate"; so she named him Asher.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest, and he found dudaim in the field and brought them to Leah, his mother, and Rachel said to Leah, "Now give me some of your son's dudaim."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband, that [you wish] also to take my son's dudaim?" So Rachel said, "Therefore, he shall sleep with you tonight as payment for your son's dudaim."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">When Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah came forth toward him, and she said, "You shall come to me, because I have hired you with my son's dudaim," and he slept with her on that night.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Leah said, "God has given [me] my reward for I have given my maidservant to my husband"; so she named him Issachar.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Leah said, "God has given me a good portion. This time, my husband will live with me, for I have borne him six sons"; so she named him Zebulun.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And afterwards, she bore a daughter, and she named her Dinah.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and He opened her womb.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And she conceived and bore a son, and she said, "God has taken away my reproach."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">So she named him Joseph, saying, "May the Lord grant me yet another son!"</pasuk><pasuk id="25">It came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, and I will go to my place and to my land.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Give [me] my wives and my children for whom I worked for you, and I will go, for you know my work, which I have worked for you."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Laban said to him, "If only I have now found favor in your eyes! I have divined, and the Lord has blessed me for your sake."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Then he said, "Specify your wages for me, and I will give [them]."</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And he said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock was with me.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">For the little that you had before me has increased in multitude, and the Lord blessed you upon my arrival; but now, when will I, too, provide [something] for my household? "</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "You shall give me nothing; if you do this thing for me, I will return, I will pasture your flocks, [and] I will watch [them].</pasuk><pasuk id="32">I will pass throughout all your flocks today, removing from there every speckled and spotted kid, and every brown lamb among the sheep, and [every] spotted and speckled [one from] among the goats, and this shall be my wages.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And my righteousness will testify for me at a future date for it will come upon my wages before you. Whatever is not speckled or spotted among the goats or brown among the sheep [shall be counted as] stolen with me."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And Laban said, "Very well! If only it would be as you say!"</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And he removed on that day the ringed and the spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, whichever had white on it, and all the brown [from] among the sheep, and he gave [them] into the hands of his sons.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob tended Laban's remaining animals.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Jacob took himself moist rod[s] of trembling poplar and hazelnut, and chestnut, and he peeled white streaks upon them, baring the white that was on the rods.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And he thrust the rods that he had peeled, into the gutters in the watering troughs where the animals would come to drink opposite the [other] animals, and they would come into heat when they came to drink.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And the flocks came into heat by the rods, and the animals bore ringed, spotted, and striped [young].</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And Jacob separated the sheep, and he turned the faces of the animals toward the ringed one[s] and every brown one among Laban's animals, and he made himself flocks by himself, and he did not place them with Laban's animals.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And it came to pass, that whenever the animals that were bearing their first would come into heat, Jacob would place the rods in the troughs, before the eyes of the animals, [in order] to bring them into heat by [means of] the rods.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">But if the animals would delay, he would not place them, so that the ones that delayed were Laban's, and the ones that bore their first became Jacob's.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And the man became exceedingly wealthy, and he had prolific animals, and maidservants and manservants, and camels and donkeys.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="31"><pasuk id="1">And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken all that belonged to our father, and from what belonged to our father, he has amassed this entire fortune."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Jacob saw Laban's countenance, that he was not disposed toward him as [he had been] yesterday and the day before.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the Lord said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your forefathers and to your birthplace, and I will be with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flocks.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he said to them, "I see your father's countenance, that he is not disposed toward me [as he was] yesterday and the day before, but the God of my father was with me.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And you know that with all my might I served your father.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">But your father mocked me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">If he would say thus, 'Speckled ones shall be your wages,' all the animals would bear speckled ones, and if he would say thus, 'Ringed ones shall be your wages,' all the animals would bear ringed ones.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Thus, God separated your father's livestock and gave it to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And it came to pass at the time the animals came into heat, that I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the he goats that mounted the animals were ringed, speckled, and striped.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And an angel of God said to me in a dream, 'Jacob!' And I said, 'Here I am.'</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And he said, 'Now lift your eyes and see [that] all the he goats mounting the animals are ringed, speckled, and striped, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">I am the God of Beth el, where you anointed a monument, where you pronounced to Me a vow. Now, arise, go forth from this land and return to the land of your birth.'"</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Rachel and Leah replied and said to him, "Do we still have a share or an inheritance in our father's house?</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Are we not considered by him as strangers, for he sold us and also consumed our money?</pasuk><pasuk id="16">But all the wealth that God separated from our father is ours and our children's. So now, all that God said to you, do."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">So Jacob rose, and he lifted up his sons and his wives upon the camels.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he led all his livestock and all his possessions that he had acquired, the purchase of his acquisition, which he had acquired in Padan aram, to come to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and [meanwhile] Rachel stole her father's teraphim.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Jacob concealed from Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">So he and all that were his fled, and he arose and crossed the river, and he directed his face toward Mount Gilead.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">On the third day, Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">So he took his kinsmen with him, and he pursued him seven days' journey, and he overtook him at Mount Gilead.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night, and He said to him, "Beware lest you speak with Jacob either good or evil."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Laban overtook Jacob, and Jacob pitched his tent on the mountain, and Laban pitched with his kinsmen on Mount Gilead.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you concealed from me, and led away my daughters like prisoners of war?</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Why have you fled secretly, and concealed from me, and not told me? I would have sent you away with joy and with songs, and with drum and with harp.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and daughters. Now, you have acted foolishly.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">I have the power to inflict harm upon you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Beware of speaking with Jacob either good or bad.'</pasuk><pasuk id="30">But now, you have gone away, for you longed for your father's house, [but]why have you stolen my gods?"</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And Jacob replied, and he said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, because I said, 'Lest you steal your daughters from me.'</pasuk><pasuk id="32">The one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our brothers, recognize for yourself what is with me, and take [it] for yourself." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">So Laban entered Jacob's tent and Leah's tent and the tent[s] of the two handmaids, but he did not find [them]; and he had come out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">But Rachel had taken the teraphim and placed them into the camel saddle and sat upon them; so Laban felt about the entire tent but did not find [them].</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And she said to her father, "Let my lord not be annoyed, for I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched, but did not find the teraphim.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Jacob was annoyed, and he quarreled with Laban, and he said to Laban, "What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have pursued me?</pasuk><pasuk id="37">For you have felt about all my things. What have you found of all the utensils of your house? Put it here, in the presence of my kinsmen and your kinsmen, and let them decide between the two of us.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">Already twenty years have I been with you, and your ewes and she goats have not aborted, neither have I eaten the rams of your flocks.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">I have not brought home to you anything torn [by other animals]; I would suffer its loss; from my hand you would demand it, what was stolen by day and what was stolen at night.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">I was [in the field] by day when the heat consumed me, and the frost at night, and my sleep wandered from my eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">This is twenty years that I have spent in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your animals, and you changed my wages ten times ten times.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">Had not the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, been for me, you would now have sent me away empty handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and He reproved [you] last night."</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the animals are my animals, and all that you see is mine. Now, what would I do to these daughters of mine today, or to their children, whom they have borne?</pasuk><pasuk id="44">So now, come, let us form a covenant, you and I, and may He be a witness between me and you."</pasuk><pasuk id="45">So Jacob took a stone and set it up [as] a monument.</pasuk><pasuk id="46">And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones," and they took stones and made a pile, and they ate there by the pile.</pasuk><pasuk id="47">And Laban called it Yegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Gal ed.</pasuk><pasuk id="48">And Laban said, "This pile is a witness between me and you today." Therefore, he called it Gal ed.</pasuk><pasuk id="49">And Mizpah, because he said, "May the Lord look between me and you when we are hidden from each other.</pasuk><pasuk id="50">If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters when no one is with us, behold! God is a witness between me and you."</pasuk><pasuk id="51">And Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this pile and behold this monument, which I have cast between me and you.</pasuk><pasuk id="52">This pile is a witness, and this monument is a witness, that I will not pass this pile [to go] to you and that you shall not pass this pile and this monument to [come to] me to [do] harm.</pasuk><pasuk id="53">May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor judge between us, the god of their father." And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.</pasuk><pasuk id="54">And Jacob slaughtered a slaughtering on the mountain, and he invited his friends to eat a meal, and they ate bread and lodged on the mountain.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="32"><pasuk id="1">And Laban arose early in the morning and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them, and Laban went and returned to his place.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Jacob went on his way, and angels of God met him.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Jacob said when he saw them, "This is the camp of God," and he named the place Mahanaim.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Jacob sent angels ahead of him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he commanded them, saying, "So shall you say to my master to Esau, 'Thus said your servant Jacob, "I have sojourned with Laban, and I have tarried until now.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I have acquired oxen and donkeys, flocks, manservants, and maidservants, and I have sent to tell [this] to my master, to find favor in your eyes.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="7">The angels returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother, to Esau, and he is also coming toward you, and four hundred men are with him."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Jacob became very frightened and was distressed; so he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the cattle and the camels into two camps.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And he said, "If Esau comes to one camp and strikes it down, the remaining camp will escape."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord, Who said to me, 'Return to your land and to your birthplace, and I will do good to you.'</pasuk><pasuk id="11">I have become small from all the kindnesses and from all the truth that You have rendered Your servant, for with my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Now deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest he come and strike me, [and strike] a mother with children.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And You said, 'I will surely do good with you, and I will make your seed [as numerous] as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted because of multitude.'"</pasuk><pasuk id="14">So he lodged there on that night, and he took from what came into his hand a gift for his brother Esau:</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Two hundred she goats and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Thirty nursing camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she donkeys and ten he donkeys.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he gave into the hands of his servants each herd individually, and he said to his servants, "Pass on ahead of me and make a space between one herd and another herd."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he commanded the first one, saying, "When my brother Esau meets you, and asks you, saying, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and for whom are these before you?'</pasuk><pasuk id="19">You shall say, '[I belong] to your servant Jacob; it is a gift sent to my master, to Esau, and behold, he himself is behind us.'"</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he commanded also the second one, also the third one, also all those who followed the herds, saying, "In this manner shall you speak to Esau when you meet him.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And you shall say, 'Also, behold, your servant Jacob is behind us.'

If indeed I have found favor in your eyes, then you shall take my gift from my hand, because I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of an angel, and you have accepted me.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Now take my gift, which has been brought to you, for God has favored me [with it], and [because] I have everything." He prevailed upon him, and he took [it].</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Thereupon, he said, "Travel and we will go, and I will go alongside you."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he said to him, "My master knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and the cattle, which are raising their young, depend upon me, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Now, let my master go ahead before his servant, and I will move [at] my own slow pace, according to the pace of the work that is before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my master, to Seir."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Thereupon Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me."

And I where will I go?"</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And they took Joseph's coat, and they slaughtered a kid, and they dipped the coat in the blood.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And they sent the fine woolen coat, and they brought [it] to their father, and they said, "We have found this; now recognize whether it is your son's coat or not."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">He recognized it, and he said, "[It is] my son's coat; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn up."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And Jacob rent his garments, and he put sackcloth on his loins, and he mourned for his son many days.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And all his sons and all his daughters arose to console him, but he refused to be consoled, for he said, "Because I will descend on account of my son as a mourner to the grave"; and his father wept for him.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And the Midianites sold him to Egypt, to Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain, chief of the slaughterers.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="38"><pasuk id="1">Now it came about at that time that Judah was demoted by his brothers, and he turned away until [he came] to an Adullamite man, named Hirah.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And there Judah saw the daughter of a merchant named Shua, and he took her and came to her.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And she conceived and bore a son, and he named him Er.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And she conceived again and bore a son, and she named him Onan.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Once again she bore a son, and she named him Shelah, and he (Judah) was in Chezib when she gave birth to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, named Tamar.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Now Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">So Judah said to Onan, "Come to your brother's wife and perform the rite of the levirate, and raise up progeny for your brother."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Now Onan knew that the progeny would not be his, and it came about, when he came to his brother's wife, he wasted [his semen] on the ground, in order not to give seed to his brother.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now what he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and He put him to death also.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Then Judah said to his daughter in law Tamar, "Remain as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up," for he said, "Lest he too die, like his brothers." So Tamar went, and she remained in her father's house.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Many days passed, and Shua's daughter, Judah's wife, died; and Judah was consoled, and he went up [to watch] over his sheepshearers he and Hirah, his Adullamite friend to Timnah.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And it was told to Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father in law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">So she took off her widow's garb, covered [her head] with a veil and covered her face, and she sat down at the crossroads that were on the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up, but as for her she was not given to him for a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she covered her face.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">So he turned aside toward her to the road, and he said, "Get ready now, I will come to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter in law, and she said, "What will you give me that you should come to me?"</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he said, "I will send a kid from the herd," and she said, "[Only] if you give me a pledge until you send [it]."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">So he said, "What is the pledge that I should give you?" And she said, "Your signet, your cloak, and the staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her, and he came to her, and she conceived his likeness.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Then she arose and went away, and she took off her veil, and she donned her widow's garb.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his Adullamite friend to take the pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">So he asked the people of the place, saying, "Where is the harlot who was at the crossroads on the way?" and they said, "No harlot was here."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">So he returned to Judah, and he said, "I have not found her, and the people of the place also said, 'No harlot was here.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="23">So Judah said, "Let her take [them] for herself, lest we become a laughingstock. Behold, I sent this kid, but you did not find her."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Now it came about after nearly three months, that it was told to Judah, saying, "Your daughter in law Tamar has played the harlot, and behold, she is pregnant from harlotry." So Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">She was taken out, and she sent to her father in law, saying, "From the man to whom these belong I am pregnant," and she said, "Please recognize whose signet ring, cloak, and staff are these?"</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Then Judah recognized [them], and he said, "She is right, [it is] from me, because I did not give her to my son Shelah." But he no longer continued to be intimate with her.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And it came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And it came about when she gave birth, that he (the infant) stretched out his hand. So the midwife took and bound a crimson thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And it came about, as he was drawing back his hand, behold, his brother emerged, and she said, "With what strength you have strengthened yourself!" And he (Judah) named him Perez.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Afterwards, his brother emerged, the one upon whose hand was the crimson thread, and he named him Zerah.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="39"><pasuk id="1">Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain, chief of the slaughterers, an Egyptian man, purchased him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and whatever he (Joseph) did the Lord made prosper in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he (Joseph) served him, and he (Potiphar) appointed him over his house, and all he had he gave into his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Now it came to pass that since he had appointed him over his house and over all that he had, the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of the Lord was in all that he had, in the house and in the field.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">So he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he knew nothing about what was with him except the bread that he ate; and Joseph had handsome features and a beautiful complexion.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Now it came to pass after these events that his master's wife lifted up her eyes to Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">But he refused, and he said to his master's wife, "Behold, with me my master knows nothing about anything in the house, and all he has he has given into my hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">In this house, there is no one greater than I, and he has not withheld anything from me except you, insofar as you are his wife. Now how can I commit this great evil, and sin against God?"</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now it came about when she spoke to Joseph day in and day out, that he did not obey her, to lie beside her [and] to be with her.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it came about on a certain day, that he came to the house to do his work, and none of the people of the house were there in the house.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">So she grabbed him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" But he left his garment in her hand and fled and went outside.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now it happened, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,</pasuk><pasuk id="14">that she called to the people of her house, and she spoke to them, saying, "Look! He brought us a Hebrew man to mock us. He came to me to lie with me, but I called loudly.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And it happened that when he heard that I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me, and he fled and went outside."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">So she left his garment beside her, until his master came home.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And she told him the same thing, saying, "The Hebrew slave that you brought to us came to me to mock me.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And it happened when I raised my voice and called out, that he left his garment beside me and fled outside."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now it came about when his master heard his wife's report that she spoke to him, saying, "Your slave did such things to me," that his wrath burned.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So Joseph's master took him and put him into prison, the place where the king's prisoners were imprisoned, and he was there in the prison.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">The Lord was with Joseph, and He extended charisma to him, and He gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">So the warden of the prison delivered all the prisoners who were in the prison into Joseph's hand, and whatever they did there, he [was the one who] did it.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">The warden of the prison did not inspect anything [that was] in his (Joseph's) hand, for the Lord was with him, and whatever he did the Lord made prosper.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="40"><pasuk id="1">Now it came about after these events that the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker sinned against their master, against the king of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Pharaoh became incensed at his two chamberlains, at the chief cupbearer and at the chief baker.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And he placed them in the prison of the house of the chief of the slaughterers, into the prison, the place where Joseph was imprisoned.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the chief of the slaughterers appointed Joseph [to be] with them, and he served them, and they were a year in prison.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Now both of them dreamed a dream, each one his dream on the same night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Joseph came to them in the morning, and he saw them and behold, they were troubled.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he asked Pharaoh's chamberlains who were with him in the prison of his master's house, saying, "Why are your faces sad today?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they said to him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter for it." Joseph said to them, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Tell [them] to me now."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, and he said to him, "In my dream, behold, a vine is before me.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And on the vine are three tendrils, and it seemed to be blossoming, and its buds came out; [then] its clusters ripened into grapes.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I placed the cup on Pharaoh's palm."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Joseph said to him, "This is its meaning: the three tendrils are three days.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">In another three days, Pharaoh will number you [with the other officers], and he will restore you to your position, and you will place Pharaoh's cup into his hand, according to [your] previous custom, when you were his cupbearer.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">But remember me when things go well with you, and please do me a favor and mention me to Pharaoh, and you will get me out of this house.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">For I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here too, I have done nothing, for which they have put me into the dungeon."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Now the chief baker saw that he had interpreted well. So he said to Joseph, "Me too! In my dream, behold, there were three wicker baskets on my head.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And in the topmost basket were all kinds of Pharaoh's food, the work of a baker, and the birds were eating them from the basket atop my head."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Joseph replied and said, "This is its meaning: the three baskets represent three days.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">In another three days, Pharaoh will remove your head from you and hang you on a gallows, and the birds will eat your flesh off you."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Now it came about on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that Pharaoh made a feast for all his servants, and he counted the chief cupbearer and chief baker among his servants.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he restored the chief cupbearer to his [position as] cupbearer, and he placed the cup on Pharaoh's palm.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, and he forgot him.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="41"><pasuk id="1">It came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh was dreaming, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And behold, from the Nile were coming up seven cows, of handsome appearance and robust flesh, and they pastured in the marshland.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And behold, seven other cows were coming up after them from the Nile, of ugly appearance and lean of flesh, and they stood beside the cows [which were] on the Nile bank.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the cows of ugly appearance and lean of flesh devoured the seven cows that were of handsome appearance and healthy; then Pharaoh awoke.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he fell asleep and dreamed again, and behold, seven ears of grain were growing on one stalk, healthy and good.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And behold, seven ears of grain, thin and beaten by the east wind, were growing up after them.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears of grain; then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, a dream.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Now it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; so he sent and called all the necromancers of Egypt and all its sages, and Pharaoh related to them his dream, but no one interpreted them for Pharaoh.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Now the chief cupbearer spoke with Pharaoh, saying, "I call to mind my faults today.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me in prison, in the house of the chief slaughterer, me and the chief baker.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And we dreamed a dream on the same night, I and he; each one according to the interpretation of his dream, we dreamed.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And there with us was a Hebrew lad, a slave of the chief slaughterer, and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; [for] each [of us], he interpreted according to his dream.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And it came to pass that just as he had interpreted, so it was; me he restored to my position, and him he hanged."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">So Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they rushed him from the dungeon, and he shaved and changed his clothes, and he [then] came to Pharaoh.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter for it, but I have heard it said of you [that] you understand a dream, to interpret it."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Joseph replied to Pharaoh, saying, "Not I; God will give an answer [that will bring] peace to Pharaoh."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And behold, seven cows of robust flesh and handsome form were ascending from the Nile, and they pastured in the marshland.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And behold, seven other cows were ascending after them, emaciated and of very ugly form and with meager flesh; I have not seen such ugly ones throughout the entire land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the meager and ugly cows devoured the first seven healthy cows.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And they went inside them, but it was not known that they had gone inside of them, for their appearance was as ugly as in the beginning; then I awoke.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Then I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears of grain were growing on one stalk, full and good.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And behold, seven ears of grain, hardened, thin, and beaten by the east wind, were growing up after them.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven good ears of grain; I told the necromancers, but no one tells me [its meaning]."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dream is one; what God is doing He has told Pharaoh.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears of grain are seven years; it is one dream.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And the seven meager and ugly cows coming up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, beaten by the east wind, will be seven years of famine.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">It is this matter that I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is about to do He has shown Pharaoh.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Behold, seven years are coming, great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will destroy the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And the plenty will not be known because of that famine to follow, for it [will be] very severe.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh twice that is because the matter is ready [to emanate] from God, and God is hastening to execute it.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">So now, let Pharaoh seek out an understanding and wise man and appoint him over the land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Let Pharaoh do [this] and appoint officials over the land and prepare the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And let them collect all the food of these coming seven good years, and let them gather the grain under Pharaoh's hand, food in the cities, and keep it.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">Thus the food will remain as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not be destroyed by the famine."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">The matter pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">So Pharaoh said to his servants, "Will we find [anyone] like this, a man in whom there is the spirit of God?"</pasuk><pasuk id="39">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has let you know all this, there is no one as understanding and wise as you.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">You shall be [appointed] over my household, and through your command all my people shall be nourished; only [with] the throne will I be greater than you."</pasuk><pasuk id="41">So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Look, I have appointed you over the entire land of Egypt."</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And Pharaoh removed his ring from his hand and placed it on Joseph's hand, and he attired him [with] raiment of fine linen, and he placed the golden chain around his neck.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And he had him ride in his chariot of second rank, and they called out before him, "[This is] the king's patron," appointing him over the entire land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and besides you, no one may lift his hand or his foot in the entire land of Egypt."</pasuk><pasuk id="45">And Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath Pa'neach, and he gave him Asenath the daughter of Poti phera, the governor of On, for a wife, and Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="46">And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and Joseph went out from before Pharaoh and passed through the entire land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="47">And in the seven years of plenty, [the inhabitants of] the land gathered [food] by handfuls.</pasuk><pasuk id="48">And he collected all the food of the seven years that was in the land of Egypt, and he placed food in the cities, the food of the field surrounding the city, he put within it.</pasuk><pasuk id="49">And Joseph gathered grain like the sand of the sea, in great abundance, until [one] stopped counting, because there was no number.</pasuk><pasuk id="50">And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of the famine set in, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti phera, the governor of On, bore to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="51">And Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, for "God has caused me to forget all my toil and all my father's house."</pasuk><pasuk id="52">And the second one he named Ephraim, for "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."</pasuk><pasuk id="53">And the seven years of plenty that were in the land of Egypt were finished.</pasuk><pasuk id="54">And the seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said, and there was famine in all the lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread.</pasuk><pasuk id="55">When the entire land of Egypt hungered, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread, but Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; what he tells you, do."</pasuk><pasuk id="56">Now the famine spread over all the face of the land, and Joseph opened all [the storehouses] in which there was [grain], and he sold [it] to the Egyptians, and the famine intensified in the land of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="57">And all [the inhabitants of] the land came to Egypt to Joseph to purchase, for the famine had intensified in the entire land.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="42"><pasuk id="1">Jacob saw that there was grain being sold in Egypt; so Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you appear satiated?"</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain being sold in Egypt. Go down there and buy us [some] from there, so that we will live and not die."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">But Joseph's brother, Benjamin, Jacob did not send with his brothers, because, he said, "Lest misfortune befall him."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">So the sons of Israel came to purchase among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; it was he who sold grain to the entire populace of the land, and Joseph's brothers came and prostrated themselves to him, with their faces to the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but he made himself a stranger to them, and he spoke to them harshly, and he said to them, "Where do you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan to purchase food."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Now Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, "You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And they said to him, "No, my master, your servants have come to buy food.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">We are all sons of one man. We are honest. Your servants were never spies."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But he said to them, "No! But you have come to see the nakedness of the land."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And they said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is gone."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Joseph said to them, "This is just what I have spoken to you, saying, 'You are spies.'</pasuk><pasuk id="15">With this you shall be tested: By Pharaoh's life, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Send one of you and let him fetch your brother, and you will be imprisoned so that your words will be tested whether truth is with you, and if not, as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he put them in prison for three days.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">On the third day, Joseph said to them: "Do this and live I fear God.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">If you are honest, your one brother will be confined in your prison, and you, go bring the grain for the hunger of your households.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified, and you will not die." And they did so.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And they said to one another, "Indeed, we are guilty for our brother, that we witnessed the distress of his soul when he begged us, and we did not listen. That is why this trouble has come upon us."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Reuben answered them, saying, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Do not sin against the lad,' but you did not listen? Behold, his blood, too, is being demanded!"</pasuk><pasuk id="23">They did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And he turned away from them and wept, then returned to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon from among them and imprisoned him before their eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Joseph commanded, and they filled their vessels with grain, and [he commanded] to return their money into each one's sack, and to give them provisions for the journey, and he did so for them.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And they loaded their grain upon their donkeys, and they went away from there.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">The one opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place, and he saw his money there it was, in the mouth of his sack.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And he said to his brothers, "My money has been returned, and indeed, here it is in my sack! " Their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And they came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they told him all that had befallen them, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="30">"The man, the lord of the land, spoke to us harshly, and he accused us of spying on the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And we said to him, 'We are honest; we were never spies.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">We are twelve brothers, the sons of our father; one is gone, and today the youngest is with our father in the land of Canaan.'</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'With this I will know that you are honest; leave one of your brothers with me, and [what is needed for] the hunger of your households, take and go.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And bring your youngest brother to me, so that I will know that you are not spies, that you are honest; [then] I will give you your brother, and you may travel around in the land.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And it came to pass that they were emptying their sacks and behold! Each one's bundle of money was in his sack; they saw the bundles of their money, they and their father, and they became frightened.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And their father Jacob said to them, "You have bereaved me-Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone, and you want to take Benjamin! All these troubles have come upon me."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "You may put my two sons to death if I don't bring him (Benjamin) to you. Put him into my hand[s] and I will return him to you."</pasuk><pasuk id="38">But he (Jacob) said, "My son shall not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he alone is left, and if misfortune befalls him on the way you are going, you will bring down my gray head in sorrow to the grave."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="43"><pasuk id="1">But the hunger was severe in the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And it came to pass, when they finished eating the grain that they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, "Go back [and] buy us a little food."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">But Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man warned us repeatedly, saying, 'You shall not see my face if your brother is not with you.'</pasuk><pasuk id="4">If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">But if you do not send [him], we will not go down, because the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face if your brother is not with you.'

The days of the years of my life have been few and miserable, and they have not reached the days of the years of the lives of my forefathers in the days of their sojournings."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">So Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left Pharaoh's presence.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had mandated.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Joseph sustained his father and his brothers and his father's entire household [with] bread according to the young children.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now there was no food in the entire land, for the famine had grown exceedingly severe, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted because of the famine.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Joseph collected all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan with the grain that they were buying, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now the money was depleted from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, and all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, "Give us food; why should we die in your presence, since the money has been used up?"</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Joseph said, "Give [me] your livestock, and I will give you [food in return] for your livestock, if the money has been used up."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food [in return] for the horses and for the livestock in flocks and in cattle and in donkeys, and he provided them with food [in return] for all their livestock in that year.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">That year ended, and they came to him in the second year, and they said to him, "We will not hide from my lord, for insofar as the money and the property in animals have been forfeited to my lord, nothing remains before my lord, except our bodies and our farmland.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our farmland? Buy us and our farmland for food, so that we and our farmland will be slaves to Pharaoh, and give [us] seed, so that we live and not die, and the soil will not lie fallow."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So Joseph bought all the farmland of the Egyptians for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold, each one his field, for the famine had become too strong for them, and the land became Pharaoh's.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he transferred the populace to the cities, from [one] end of the boundary of Egypt to its [other] end.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Only the farmland of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they ate their allotment that Pharaoh had given them; therefore, they did not sell their farmland.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your farmland today for Pharaoh. Behold, you have seed, so sow the soil.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And it shall be concerning the crops, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and the [remaining] four parts shall be yours: for seed for [your] field[s], for your food, for those in your houses, and for your young children to eat."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">They replied, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in my lord's eyes, and we will be slaves to Pharaoh."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">So Joseph made it a statute to this day concerning the farmland of Egypt for the one fifth. Only the farmland of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen, and they acquired property in it, and they were prolific and multiplied greatly.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years, and Jacob's days, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty seven years.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have now found favor in your eyes, now place your hand beneath my thigh, and you shall deal with me with lovingkindness and truth; do not bury me now in Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">I will lie with my forefathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and you shall bury me in their grave." And he said, "I will do as you say."</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And he said, "Swear to me. " So he swore to him, and Israel prostrated himself on the head of the bed.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="48"><pasuk id="1">Now it came to pass after these incidents that [someone] said to Joseph, "Behold, your father is ill." So he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And [someone] told Jacob and said, "Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you." And Israel summoned his strength and sat up on the bed.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Jacob said to Joseph, "Almighty God appeared to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and He blessed me.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And He said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and cause you to multiply, and I will make you into a congregation of peoples, and I will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting inheritance.'</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And now, [as for] your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt, until I came to you, to the land of Egypt they are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine like Reuben and Simeon.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">But your children, if you beget [any] after them, shall be yours; by their brothers' names they shall be called in their inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">As for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died to me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still a stretch of land to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Then Israel saw Joseph's sons, and he said, "Who are these?"</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God gave me here." So he said, "Now bring them near to me, so that I may bless them."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now Israel's eyes had become heavy with age, [to the extent that] he could not see. So he drew them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Israel said to Joseph, "I had not expected to see [even] your face, and behold, God has shown me your children too."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Joseph took them out from upon his [Jacob's] knees, and he prostrated himself to the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Joseph took them both, Ephraim at his right, from Israel's left, and Manasseh at his left, from Israel's right, and he brought [them] near to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">But Israel stretched out his right hand and placed [it] on Ephraim's head, although he was the younger, and his left hand [he placed] on Manasseh's head. He guided his hands deliberately, for Manasseh was the firstborn.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he blessed Joseph and said, "God, before Whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, walked, God Who sustained me as long as I am alive, until this day,</pasuk><pasuk id="16">may the angel who redeemed me from all harm bless the youths, and may they be called by my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, and may they multiply abundantly like fish, in the midst of the land."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Joseph saw that his father was placing his right hand on Ephraim's head, and it displeased him. So he held up his father's hand to remove it from upon Ephraim's head [to place it] on Manasseh's head.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, Father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">But his father refused, and he said, "I know, my son, I know; he too will become a people, and he too will be great. But his younger brother will be greater than he, and his children['s fame] will fill the nations."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So he blessed them on that day, saying, "With you, Israel will bless, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh,' " and he placed Ephraim before Manasseh.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am going to die, and God will be with you, and He will return you to the land of your forefathers.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And I have given you one portion over your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="49"><pasuk id="1">Jacob called for his sons and said, "Gather and I will tell you what will happen to you at the end of days.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Gather and listen, sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel, your father.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength and the first of my might.
