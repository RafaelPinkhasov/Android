      <text title="The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: ">Our Rabbis taught (Shevu. 35b): Every Solomon (for they were at a loss to explain why Scripture did not mention his father, as it did in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes) mentioned in the Song of Songs is sacred (refers to God), the King to Whom peace (שָׁלוֹם) belongs. It is a song that is above all songs, which was recited to the Holy One, blessed be He, by His congregation and His people, the congregation of Israel. Rabbi Akiva said: The world was never as worthy as on the day that the Song of Songs was given to Israel, for all the Writings are holy, whereas the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: To what can this be compared? To a king who took a se’ah of wheat and gave it to a baker. He said to him, “Extract for me so much fine flour, so much bran, so much coarse bran, and you shall produce enough fine flour for one white loaf, sifted and superior.” So are all the Writings holy and the Song of Songs the holiest of the holy, for it is all comprised of fear of Heaven and the acceptance of the yoke of His kingdom.</text>

      <text title="Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: ">She recites this song with her mouth, in her exile and in her widowhood: “If only King Solomon would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth as of old,” because in some places they kiss on the back of the hand or on the shoulder, but I desire and wish that he behave toward me as he behaved toward me originally, like a bridegroom with a bride, mouth to mouth.</text>
      <text title="for… is better: ">your love [is better] to me more than any wine banquet and more than any pleasure and joy. In the Hebrew language, every banquet of pleasure and joy is called after the wine, as it is stated (Esther 7:8): “to the house of the wine feast” ; (Isa. 24:9): “In song they shall not drink wine” ; (ibid. 5:12): “And there were harp and lute, tambourine and flute, and wine at their drinking feasts.” This is the explanation of its apparent meaning. This figure of speech was used because He gave them His Torah and spoke to them face to face, and that love is still more pleasant to them than any pleasure, and they are assured by Him that He will appear to them to explain to them the secret of its reasons and its hidden mysteries, and they entreat Him to fulfill His word, and this is the meaning of “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”</text>

      <text title="Because of the fragrance of your goodly oils: ">A good name is referred to by the expression, “good oil.”</text>
      <text title="Because of the fragrance of your goodly oils: ">that those dwelling at the ends of the earth smelled, [i.e.,] those who heard of Your good fame when You performed awesome deeds in Egypt.</text>
      <text title="your name is ‘oil poured forth.’: ">Your name is [thus] called. It is said about you that you are oil that is constantly being poured forth so that your fragrant scent wafts forth to a distance, for so is the nature of fragrant oil. As long as it is in a sealed bottle, its scent does not carry. If one opens it and pours the oil into another vessel, its scent carries.</text>
      <text title="Therefore, the maidens loved you: ">Jethro came at the sound of the news and converted; also Rahab the harlot said, (Josh. 2:10f.): “For we have heard how the Lord dried up, etc.,” and thereby, “the Lord your God, He is God in heaven, etc.”</text>
      <text title="maidens: ">virgins, since the text compares Him to a youth whose beloved holds him dear, and according to the allegory, the maidens are the nations.</text>

    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="Draw me, we will run after you: ">I heard from your messengers a hint that you said to draw me, and I said, “We will run after you to be your wife.”</text>
      <text title="the king brought me to his chambers: ">And even this very day, I still have joy and happiness that I cleaved to you.</text>
      <text title="We will recall your love: ">Even today, in living widowhood, I recall your early love more than any banquet of pleasure and joy.</text>
      <text title="they have loved you sincerely: ">a strong love, a straightforward love, without crookedness (Heb. עקיבה) or deceit (Heb. רכסים), [after Isaiah 40: 4: and the crooked terrain (הֶעָקֹב) shall become a plain and the rugged mountains (וְהָרְכָסִים) a valley], that my ancestors and I loved you in those days. This is its simple meaning according to its context, and according to its allegorical meaning, they mention before Him the loving kindness of [their] youth, the love of [their] nuptials, their following Him in the desert, a land of aridness and darkness, and they did not even prepare supplies for themselves, but they believed in Him and in His messenger, and they did not say, “How will we go out into the desert, which is not a land of seed or food,” but they followed Him, and He brought them into the midst of the chambers of the encompassment of His clouds. With this, they are still joyful today and happy in Him despite their afflictions and distress, and they delight in the Torah, and there they recall His love more than wine and the sincerity of their love for Him.</text>

      <text title="I am black but comely, etc.: ">You, my friends, let me not be light in your eyes even if my husband has left me because of my blackness, for I am black because of the sun’s gaze, but I am comely with the shape of beautiful limbs, and if I am black as the tents of Kedar, which are blackened by the rain, for they are constantly spread out in the deserts, I am easily cleansed to be like the curtains of Solomon. The allegory is that the congregation of Israel says to the nations: I am black in my deeds, but I am comely in the deeds of my ancestors, and even some of my deeds are comely. If I am guilty of the iniquity of the [Golden] Calf, I can counter it with the merit of the acceptance of the Torah (Song Rabbah). He calls the nations the daughters of Jerusalem because she [Jerusalem] is destined to become the metropolis for them all, as Ezekiel prophesied (16:61): “and I shall give them to you for daughters,” like (Josh. 15:45): “Ekron, with her towns (וּבְנוֹהֶיהָ).”</text>

      <text title="Do not look upon me: ">Do not look upon me disdainfully [like (I Sam. 6:19) “for they had gazed upon the Ark of the Lord”].</text>
      <text title="because I am swarthy: ">For my blackness and my ugliness are not from my mother’s womb, but from tanning from the sun, for that blackness can easily be whitened by staying in the shade.</text>
      <text title="my mother’s sons were incensed against me: ">These are the Egyptians among whom I grew up, and they went up with me in the mixed multitude; they were incensed against me with their enticement and their seduction until they made me…</text>
      <text title="a keeper of the vineyards: ">and there the sun tanned me and I became blackened; i.e., they made me a worshipper of alien gods, but my own vineyard, which I had from my forefathers, I did not keep. We find that in the Scripture, leaders are called by an expression of vineyards, as it is said (Hos. 2:17): “And I will give to her her vineyards from there,” which the Targum renders: “And I will appoint her leaders for her.” And similarly (Job 24:18): “he will not turn by the way of the vineyards.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="Tell me, you whom my soul loves: ">The Divine Spirit repeatedly compares her to the flock that is beloved to the shepherd. The congregation of Israel says before Him as a woman to her husband, “Tell me, You Whom my soul loves, where do You feed Your flock among these wolves in whose midst they are, and where do You rest them at noon, in this exile, which is a distressful time for them, like noon, which is a distressful time for the flock?”</text>
      <text title="for why should I be like one who veils herself: ">And if you ask, “What does it concern you?” It is not dignified for you that I should be like a mourner, with a veil over my lip, weeping for my flock.</text>
      <text title="beside the flocks of your companions: ">beside the flocks of the other shepherds, who pasture flocks as you do; i.e., among the flocks of the heathens, who rely on pagan deities, and who have kings and princes who lead them.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="If you do not, etc.: ">This is the shepherd’s reply: If you do not know where you should go to feed your flock, you, O fairest of women, for the shepherd has ceased pasturing them.</text>
      <text title="go your way in the footsteps of the flocks: ">Look at the footsteps, the way that the flocks went, and the heels are discernible, traces in French, tracks. There are many similar instances in Scripture, e.g. (Ps. 77:20): “and Your steps (וְעִקְבוֹתֶי) were not known” ; (Jer. 13:22): “your steps (עֲקֵבָיִ) were cut off” ; (Gen. 49:19): “and his troops will return in their tracks (עָקֵב).” He will return in his tracks; now go that way.</text>
      <text title="and pasture your kids beside the shepherds’ dwellings: ">among the dwellings of the other shepherds beside whom you are, and this is the allegory: If you do not know, My assembly and My congregation, O fairest of women, [the fairest] of the nations, where you will pasture and be saved from the hand of those who oppress you, to be among them, and that your children should not perish, ponder the ways of your early ancestors, who received My Torah and kept My watch and My commandments, and go in their ways, and as a reward for this, you will pasture your kids beside the princes of the nations, and so did Jeremiah say (31:20): “Set up markers for yourself… put your heart to the highway, etc.”</text>

    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="At the gathering of the steeds of Pharaoh’s chariots have I silenced you, my beloved: ">Heb. לְסֻסָתִי. This “lammed” is like the “lammed” of (Jer. 10:13): “At the sound of (לְקוֹל) His giving a multitude of waters,” and like (above verse 3): “At the fragrance of (לְרֵיחַ) your oils.” At the gathering of many stee ds, for I gathered my camps to go forth toward you in the chariots of Pharaoh to save you, as it is said (Hab. 3:15): “You trampled in the sea with your steeds,” many steeds. There I silenced you, my beloved. I silenced you from your cry, as it is written (Exod. 14:14): “and you shall be silent.” I saw this in Aggadic works (Song Rabbah). Another explanation: דִמִיתִ רַעְיָתִי -There I demonstrated to all that you are my beloved.</text>
      <text title="steeds: ">Heb. לְסֻסָתִי, means a gathering of horses, and in the French language, chevalchie, troop of horses, cavalcade. דִמִיתִ is adesmay in Old French, like (Jud. 20:5): “Me they intended (דִמוּ) to kill,” for there I adorned you with beautiful ornaments.</text>

    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="11">
      <text title="We will make you rows of gold: ">I and My tribunal decided before the arrival of Pharaoh that I should entice him and strengthen his heart to pursue you with all the best of his hidden treasures, so that we should make rows of golden ornaments for you.</text>
      <text title="with studs of silver: ">that were already in your possession, that you took out of Egypt, for the plunder at the sea was greater than the plunder in Egypt.</text>

      <text title="While the king was still at his table: ">The congregation of Israel replies and says, “All this is true. You bestowed good upon me, but I repaid You with evil, for while the king was still at the table of his wedding banquet…”</text>
      <text title="my spikenard gave forth its fragrance: ">This is instead of saying, “gave forth its stench.” When the Shechinah was still at Sinai, I sinned with the Calf; Scripture describes it with an expression of love, “gave forth its fragrance,” and did not write, “stank,” or “became putrid,” because Scripture speaks euphemistically. [Rashi from Shab. 88b] (According to the Tosafists, it does not say, “stank,” because of euphemism, and it does not say, “abandoned its fragrance,” because of love.)</text>

    <pasuk id="13">
      <text title="A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me: ">My beloved has become to me as one who has a bundle of myrrh in his bosom, and he said to him, “Here, take this bundle, which will give a more fragrant scent than the first one that you lost.” So was the Holy One, blessed be He, appeased by Israel for the incident of the Calf and found them an atonement for their iniquity and said: Donate to the Tabernacle, and let the gold of the Tabernacle atone for the gold of the Calf.</text>
      <text title="between my breasts he shall lie: ">Even though I betrayed him, he said to dwell there.</text>
      <text title="between my breasts: ">between the two staves of the Ark.</text>

      <text title="A cluster of henna-flowers Heb.: ">כֹּפֶר. There is a spice called כֹּפֶר, like (below 4:12): “Henna- flowers (כְּפָרִים) with spikenard,” and it is shaped like a sort of cluster.</text>
      <text title="in the vineyards of Ein-Gedi: ">The name of a place, and there it is common. I saw in an aggadah (Song Zuta) that those vineyards produce fruits four or five times a year, and this is symbolic of the many atonements and forgivenesses that the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave them for the many trials that they tried Him in the desert.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="15">
      <text title="Behold, you are comely, my beloved: ">I was ashamed of my sin, but He encouraged me with appeasing words, saying, (Num. 14:20): “I have forgiven according to your words,” and you are most fair, for your eyes are like doves; i.e., a bride whose eyes are ugly-her entire body requires examination but [a bride] whose eyes are beautiful, her body requires no examination. (Song Rabbah 4). The allegorical meaning is: I forgave you for your iniquity, and behold you are fair with [your statement of] “Let us do,” and you are fair with [your statement of] “Let us hear” ; fair with the deeds of your forefathers and fair with your own deeds, because…</text>
      <text title="your eyes are like doves: ">There are righteous among you who clung to Me like a dove, which, as soon as it recognizes its mate, does not abandon it to mate with another. Similarly, (Exod. 32:26): “and all the sons of Levi gathered to him,” and they did not err with the Calf, and moreover, behold you are fair with the work of the Tabernacle, as it is said (ibid. 39: 43): “and behold, they made it, etc. and Moses blessed them” ; behold he praised them for that.</text>

      <text title="yea pleasant: ">For You overlooked my transgression and caused Your Shechinah to rest in our midst, and this is the praise of the descent of the fire (Lev. 9:24): “and all the people saw and shouted for joy.”</text>
      <text title="also our couch is leafy: ">Through your pleasantness, behold our couch is leafy with our sons and with our daughters, all of whom gather to You here, as it is said (ibid. 8: 4): “and the congregation gathered [to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting].” The Tabernacle is called a bed, as it is said (below 3: 7): “Behold, the litter of Solomon,” and the Temple is called a bed, as it is said concerning Joash (II Chron. 22:11, II Kings 11:2): “in the bed chamber” which was in the “House of the Lord” (ibid. 3), because they [the Sanctuaries] are the source of Israel’s fruitfulness and procreation.</text>

      <text title="so is my beloved among the sons: ">among the young men. The allegory is that so is the Holy One, blessed be He, chosen above all the gods. Therefore, in His shade I delighted and sat. The Midrash Aggadah (Song Rabbah), [states]: This apple tree-all flee from it because it has no shade. So did all the nations flee from the Holy One, blessed be He, at the giving of the Torah, but I in His shade I delighted and sat.</text>

There are many aggadic midrashim but they do not fit the sequence of the topics, for I see that Solomon prophesied and spoke about the Exodus from Egypt and about the giving of the Torah, the Tabernacle, the entry to the Land, the Temple, the Babylonian exile, and the coming of the Second Temple and its destruction.</text>

That is the meaning of “Seize for us” these “foxes,” the little ones with the big ones, for even the little ones were destroying the vineyards, when our vineyards were still with סְמָדַר, when the grapes were tiny. When a Jewish woman gave birth to a male and hid him, the Egyptians entered their houses and searched for the males, but the baby was concealed, and he was a year or two old. So they would bring a baby from an Egyptian home; the Egyptian baby would speak, and the Jewish baby would answer him from his hiding place; and they would seize him and cast him into the Nile. Now why does he call them foxes? Just as the fox looks to turn around to flee, so did the Egyptians look behind them, as it is written (Exod. 14:25): “I shall flee from before Israel.”</text>

      <text title="from within your kerchief; your hair is like a flock of goats: ">This praise is a paradigm of the praise of a woman beloved by her bridegroom. Within your kerchief, your hair is beautiful and glistens with brilliance and whiteness like the hair of white goats descending from the mountains, whose hair gleams in the distance. And in the allegorical sense, [it is said of] the congregation of Israel that within your camps and your tents, even the empty ones among you are as dear to Me as Jacob and his sons, who streamed down to descend from Mount Gilead when Laban overtook them there. Another explanation: As those who mobilized against Midian beyond the Jordan, which is in the land of Gilead, and this language is found in Midrash Shir Hashirim.</text>
      <text title="within: ">Heb. מִבַּעַד. This is a term meaning “within,” for the majority of בְּעַד in Scripture refers to something that covers and shields against something else, like (Job 9:7): “and He sealed up (וּבְעַד) the stars” ; (Jonah 2:7): “the earth-its bars are closed on me (בְּעַדִי) ” ; (Job 22:13): “Does He judge through (הַבְעַד) the dark cloud?” And מִבַּעַד is the thing that is within that בְּעַד. Therefore, he says, מִבַּעַד.</text>
      <text title="your kerchief: ">Heb. צַמָּתֵ. An expression denoting a thing that confines the hair so that it does not show, and this refers to a kerchief and ribbons. It is impossible to interpret צַמָּתֵ as meaning a veil (צֹמֶת) , where the “tav” is a radical, for were that so, it would have to be punctuated with a “dagesh” when immediately preceding a “hey,” which makes it the feminine possessive, or a “vav,” which makes it the masculine possessive, like the “tav” of שַּׁבָּת, which, when given to a female, (i.e., in the feminine possessive form), is punctuated with a “dagesh,” like (Hos. 2:13): “her festival[s], her new moon[s], and her Sabbath[s] (שַּׁבַּתָּהּ) ,” and so for the masculine, (Num. 28:10): “the burnt offering of a Sabbath in its Sabbath (בְּשַּׁבַּתּוֹ) ,” but the “tav” of צַמָּתֵ, which is not punctuated with a “dagesh,” perforce comes instead of a “hey,” and the name of the kerchief is צַמָה, and when it is possessive, to be given to a male or female, the “hey” is converted to a “tav” without a “dagesh”; e.g. שִּׁפְחָה becomes שִּׁפְחָתוֹ or שִּׁפְחָתָה, and so אָמָה [becomes] אֶמָתוֹ, אֲמָתָה; עֶרְוָה (nakedness) [becomes] עֶרְוָתוֹ, עֶרְוָתָה, and likewise, this one, צָמָה [becomes] צַמָתוֹ, צַמָתָה, צַמָּתִי, צַמָתֵ.</text>
      <text title="that streamed: ">Heb. שֶׁגָלְשׁוּ, that they became bald. גִבֵּחַ is rendered by the Targum as גְלוֹשּׁ. When the animals descend from the mountain, the mountain becomes bald and bare of them.</text>

      <text title="all of whom are perfect: ">Heb. מַתְאִימוֹת, an expression of perfection, (Ps. 38:4): “There is no soundness (מְתֹם) ,” i.e., perfect, enterins in Old French, whole, perfect, sound.</text>
      <text title="bereavement: ">There is neither bereavement nor blemish among them. This example is given as symbolic of the mighty men of Israel, who cut down and devour their enemies surrounding them with their teeth, and yet they distance themselves from stealing from Israelites and from immoral acts, so that they should not become sullied with sin. Now this praise was given concerning the twelve thousand men who mobilized against Midian with count and number, of whom not one was suspected of committing immoral acts, as it is written (Num. 31:49): “and not a single man among us is missing.” And they even brought atonements for erotic thoughts, and they were not suspected of theft, for Scripture attests for them, (ibid. verses 11f.): “And they took all the booty and they brought it to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, etc.,” and not one of them concealed even one cow or one donkey.</text>

      <text title="and your speech: ">Heb. וּמִדְבָּרֵ your speech, and this is of the structure of (Ezek. 33:30): “who talk (הַנִדְבָּרִים) about you beside the walls” ; (Mal. 3:16): “Then the God-fearing men spoke (נִדְבְּרוּ),” parlediz in Old French; words, speech, talk.</text>

And in the language of the Talmud, it is called “the pomegranate of the face,” and it resembles the split half of a pomegranate from the outside, which is red and round. This is a praise in terms of a woman’s beauty, and our Sages explained the allegory to mean: even your worthless ones (רֵיקָנִים, lit. empty ones) are full of mitzvoth as a pomegranate.</text>

This is the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which was Israel’s strength and fortification, and that tower was built as a model, and was built for beauty, so that everyone should look at it to learn its forms and the beauty of its architecture, and the word (לְתַלְפִּיּוֹת) is of the grammatical structure of (Job 35: 11): “He teaches us (מַלְפֵנוּ) more than the beasts of the earth,” and the “tav” in תַלְפִּיוֹת is like the “tav” in תַרְמִית (guile) and תַבְנִית (form).</text>
      <text title="a thousand shields hanging on it: ">It was the custom of the princes to hang their shields and their quivers on the walls of the towers.</text>

It is also possible to render אֶלֶף הַמָּגֵן as מָגֵן הָאֶלֶף, the shield of the thousand, alluding to (I Chron. 16:15): “the word He had commanded to the thousandth [לְאֶלֶף] generation.”</text>
      <text title="all the quivers of the mighty men: ">We find that disciples are symbolized by arrows and quivers, as is stated (Ps. 127:4f.): “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of one’s youth. Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them.”</text>

      <text title="Your two breasts: ">symbolize the Tablets.</text>
      <text title="the twins of a gazelle: ">exactly corresponding in one measure; the five commandments on this one (side of the Tablets, correspond to) the five commandments on the other (side of the Tablets), each commandment corresponding to a commandment. “I [am the Lord your God]” corresponds to “You shall not murder,” for the murderer diminishes the semblance of the Holy One, blessed be He. “You shall not have [any other gods before Me]” corresponds to “You shall not commit adultery,” for one who commits idolatry is like an adulterous woman, who takes strangers instead of her husband. “You shall not hear [the name of the Lord your God in vain]” corresponds to “You shall not steal,” for one who steals will ultimately swear falsely. “Remember [the Sabbath day to keep it holy]” corresponds to “You shall not bear [false witness against your neighbor],” for one who profanes the Sabbath testifies falsely against his Creator, saying that He did not rest on the Sabbath of Creation. “Honor [your father and mother]” corresponds to “You shall not covet,” for one who covets is destined to beget a son who slights him and honors one who is not his father.</text>

[This is] in Genesis Rabbah (55:7). i.e., When they will then sin before Me by profaning My sacred offerings and by spurning My meal offerings in the days of Hophni and Phinehas (I Sam. 3:12-17), I will withdraw from them and I will abandon this Tabernacle, and I will choose for Myself Mount Moriah, the everlasting Temple, and there, ” You are all fair… and there is no blemish in you," and there I will accept all your sacrifices.</text>

Beshallach 10), your following Me in the desert and your travels and your encampments by My command, and your coming to the peak of Senir and Hermon, which were the dens of lions, namely Sihon and Og (Song Rabbah, Mid. Zuta). Another explanation: From the peak of Amanah. This is a mountain on the northern boundary of the Land of Israel, named Amanah, and in the language of the Mishnah, the mountains of Amnon, and [this is] Mount Hor, about which it says: (Num. 34:6): “from the Great Sea you shall draw a line extending to Mount Hor.” When the exiles gather and arrive there, they will look from there and see the boundary of the Land of Israel and the air of Israel, and they will rejoice and utter thanks.

This is something that does not apply to later generations, and because of this, it is stated: “I have eaten my sugar cane with my sugar.” There is honey that grows in canes, as it is stated (I Sam. 14:27): “into the sugar canes (בְּיַעְרַת הַדְבַשּׁ),” and יַעְרַת is a term referring to canes [or reeds], as it is stated (Exod. 2:3): “and she placed [it] in the reeds (בַּסוּף),” [which Onkelos renders:] וּשֲּׁוּיתָהּ בְּיַעְרָא, and the sugar is sucked out and the wood is discarded.

      <text title="Open for me: ">Do not cause Me to withdraw from you.</text>
      <text title="for my head is full of dew: ">A term referring to a man who comes at night, knocking on the door of his beloved. He says thus, “Because of love for you, I have come at night at the time of dew or rain,” and the allegory is that, “My head is full of dew because I am full of goodwill and satisfaction with Abraham your father, whose deeds pleased Me like dew, and behold, I come to you, loaded with blessings and the payment of reward for good deeds if you return to Me.”</text>
      <text title="my locks with the drops of the night: ">In My hands there are also many categories of types of retribution, to exact retribution from those who forsake Me and anger Me. Dew is an expression connoting pleasure.</text>
      <text title="the drops of the night: ">the rains of the night, which represent hardship and weariness. רְסִיסֵי is the Targum of רְבִיבִים. (Deut. 32:2): “and like drops (וְכִרְבִיבִים) on the grass,” is translated as וְכִרְסִיסֵי מַלְקוֹשָּׁא, drops of the last rain of the season. Locks are bunches of hair stuck together, called flozels, curls, locks, and because Scripture adopted an expression of dew and rain, it adopted an expression of a head and locks, for it is usual for dew and rain to stick to the hair and locks. Both “dew” and “drops of the night” may also be explained favorably, viz. the reward for precepts that are easy to perform, like dew, and the reward for precepts that are difficult as the hardship of the drops of the night.</text>

And since Scripture commenced with the language of, “I sleep… Hark! My beloved is knocking,” it concludes with an expression apropos to an expression of knocking at the door at the time of retiring to sleep at night.</text>

And…[some] of your sons… whom you shall beget.” These are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, and also [as it is stated] concerning Josiah, through Huldah the prophetess (II Kings 22:16): “Behold, I bring calamity upon this place and upon its inhabitants, etc.” And Scripture states: (ibid. 23: 25ff): “Now, before him there was no king like him… Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn back from His great wrath, for His wrath was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked Him.

      <text title="[10] My beloved is white: ">to whiten my iniquities. Clear and white; when He appeared at Sinai, He appeared as an old man, teaching instructions, and so, when He sits in judgment (Dan. 7:9): “His garment was like white snow, and the hair of His head was like clean wool.”</text>
      <text title="and ruddy: ">to exact retribution upon His enemies, as it is stated (Isa. 63.2): “Why is Your clothing red?”</text>

      <text title="[11] His head is as the finest gold: ">The beginning of His words shone like finest gold, and so Scripture says (Ps. 119: 130): “The commencement of Your words enlightens.” The commencement of, “I am the Lord your God” showed them first that He has the right of sovereignty over them, and He then issued His decrees upon them.</text>

      <text title="black as a raven: ">because it was written before Him in black fire on white fire. Another explanation: His locks were curled when He appeared on the sea, appearing like a young man mightily waging war.</text>
      <text title="[12] His eyes are like doves beside rivulets of water: ">Like doves, whose eyes look toward their dovecotes, so are His eyes on the synagogues and study halls, for there are the sources of Torah, which is compared to water.</text>
      <text title="bathing in milk: ">When they look into the judgment, they clarify the law in its true light, to justify the just, to give him what he deserves, and to condemn the guilty, to repay his [evil] way upon his head.</text>
      <text title="fitly set: ">on the fullness of the world. They wander over the entire earth, gazing upon good and evil. Another explanation: Torah scholars, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, makes as eyes to illuminate the world, just as the eyes illuminate for man; like doves that wander from dovecote to dovecote to seek their food, so do they go from the study hall of one sage to the study hall of another sage, to seek the explanations of the Torah.</text>
      <text title="by rivulets of water: ">in the study halls, which are the sources of the water of Torah.</text>
      <text title="bathing in milk: ">Since he calls them eyes, and the eye (עַיִן) is a feminine noun, bathing (רוֹחֲצוֹת) is in the feminine conjugation. They cleanse themselves with the milk of Torah and whiten (clarify) its mysteries and enigmas.</text>
      <text title="fitly set: ">They resolve the matters appropriately. Another explanation: His eyes עֵינָיו, [like] עִנְיָנָיו His topics. The sections of the Torah, the halachoth, and the Mishnayoth are like doves which are comely in their walk beside the rivulets of water, [i.e.,] in the study halls; bathing in milk, made clear as milk, as I have explained.</text>

      <text title="[14] His hands: ">the Tablets, which He gave with His right hand, which are the work of His hands.</text>
      <text title="wheels of gold: ">These are the commandments, about which it is said (Ps. 19:11): “They are to be desired more than gold, yea more than much fine gold.” Said Rabbi Joshua the son of Nehemiah: They were made miraculously. They were of sapphire, yet they could be rolled (Song Rabbah, Tanch. Ki Thissa 26). Another explanation: because they bring about (lit. roll) much good to the world.</text>
      <text title="set with chrysolite: ">He included the 613 commandments in the Decalogue.</text>
      <text title="his abdomen is [as] a block of ivory: ">This is the Priestly Code (Leviticus), placed in the center of the Five Books of the Pentateuch, like the intestines, which are set in the middle of the body.</text>
      <text title="[as] a block of ivory, overlaid with sapphires: ">It appears as smooth as a block of ivory, and is set with many details [derived from] similar wordings, general principles, and inferences from minor to major.</text>
      <text title="[15] founded upon sockets of fine gold: ">Said Rabbi Eleazar Hakkappar: This pillar has a capitol above and a base below. Said Rabbi Samuel the son of Gadda: The sections of the Torah have a capitol above and a base below, and they are juxtaposed before them and after them, e.g., the sections of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee year, [are juxtaposed to] (Lev. 25:14): “And if you transact a sale,” to teach you how severe the dust (i.e., a minor infraction) of the Sabbatical Year is, as appears in Tractates Bava Metzia and Arachin (30b). Also, like (Num. 27: 16): “May the Lord… appoint a man over the congregation,” and (ibid. 29:2): “Command… My sacrifice, My bread.” Before you command Me about My children, command them about Me (Sifrei Num. 27:23), and similarly, many [such instances]. Therefore, it is stated: “His legs are [as] pillars of marble, founded, etc.”</text>
      <text title="his appearance is like the Lebanon: ">One who reflects and ponders over His words finds in them blossoms and sprouts, like a forest which blooms. So are the words of Torah-whoever meditates over them constantly finds new explanations in them.</text>
      <text title="chosen: ">Heb. בָּחוּר, chosen as the cedars, which are chosen for building and for strength and height.</text>
      <text title="[16] His palate is sweet: ">His words are pleasant, e.g. (Lev. 19:28): “And you shall not make a wound in your flesh for one who has died… I am the Lord,” faithful to pay reward. Is there a palate sweeter than this? Do not wound yourselves, and you will receive reward. (Ezek. 33:19): “And when a wicked man repents of his wickedness and performs justice and righteousness, he shall live because of them.” Iniquities are accounted to him as merits.

      <text title="I did not know: ">The congregation of Israel laments: I did not know to beware of sin, that I should retain my honor and my greatness, and I erred in the matter of groundless hatred and controversy, which intensified during the reign of the Hasmonean kings, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, until one of them brought the kingdom of Rome and received the kingship from their hand and became their vassal, and since then, my soul made me to be chariots, that the nobility of other nations ride upon me.</text>
      <text title="a princely people: ">Heb. עַמִי נָדִיב like:. עַם נָדִיב, the “yud” being superfluous, like the “yud” of (Deut. 33:16): “the One Who took up His abode (שֹּׁכְנִי) in the thornbush” ; (Gen. 31:39): “stolen (גְנֻבְתִי) by day” ; (Lam. 1:1): “populous (רַבָּתִי עַם).”</text>

We will appoint from you governors and rulers, like (Exod. 18:21): “And you shall appoint (תֶחֱזֶה) from all the people.” So did Rabbi Tanhuma interpret it (Bamidbar 11). Another explanation for “and we will gaze upon you” : We will ponder what greatness to give you, but she says, “What will you see for the Shulammite?” What greatness can you allot me, that will equal my greatness, or even the greatness of the divisions of the dances of the encampments in the desert?</text>

      <text title="How fair are your feet: ">in the festive pilgrimages, O daughter of princes!</text>
      <text title="The curves of your thighs are like jewels: ">A collection of gold jewels is called חֲלִי כֶתֶם, al chali in Arabic. And our Sages interpreted this as referring to the holes of the foundations [of the altar] for the libations, which were created during the Six Days of Creation, round as a thigh.</text>
      <text title="like jewels: ">Heb. חֲלָאִים, like the hollow of (חוּלְיַת) a pit.</text>

      <text title="craftsman: ">Heb. אֳמָן, like אוּמָן. In the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, the Israelites praise Him from top to bottom. They commence, so to speak, from “His head is as finest gold,” and progressively descend to “His legs are as pillars of marble,” since they come to appease Him, to draw down His Shechinah from the heavenly abodes to the earthly abodes. He, however, counts their praises from bottom to top: “How fair are your feet!” and He progressively counts until, “Your head upon you is like Carmel,” until He comes to draw them to Him.</text>

      <text title="Your navel is [like] a round basin: ">Your navel is like a basin of clear water with which they wash, and it [the basin] is made of marble, which in Arabic is called “sahar.” He compares it to a round basin because the navel is shaped like a round hole. This praise does not refer to a woman’s beauty as the above praise does, for [in] the above, her beloved praises her, but here, her companions praise her about her deeds, saying: You are worthy to join us. The image symbolizes the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which is situated in the “navel” of the world.</text>
      <text title="where no mixed wine is lacking: ">No beverage will ever cease [to be found] there; he wishes to say that no words of instruction will cease or end from there.</text>

      <text title="fenced in with roses: ">fenced and hedged about with roses. A light fence suffices her, and no one breaches it to enter. For example, a bridegroom enters the nuptial canopy, his heart longing for the nuptials and for the love of his marriage. When he comes to cohabit with her, she says to him, “I have perceived a drop of blood like [the size of] a mustard seed.” He turns his face the other way. Now no snake bit him, nor did a scorpion sting him. [Similarly,] one passes by on the road and sees freshly ripened fruit at the top of the fig trees. He stretches out his hand to take [them]. They tell him, “These belong to owners,” and he too withdraws his hand because of [the prohibition] of theft. This is the meaning of “she is fenced in with roses.”</text>

Your sages, when they sit in the gates of Jerusalem, the city of multitudes, and engage in the computation (חֶשְּׁבּוֹן) of the seasons and the signs of the zodiac-their wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples flow like pools of water. Alternatively, we can explain בְּרֵכוֹת בְּחֶשְּׁבּוֹן to mean doves, and this is a Mishnaic usage: If one buys the doves of a dovecote, he must let the first brood (בְּרִיכָה) fly away; covedes in Old French, covey, brood.</text>
      <text title="your face is as the tower of Lebanon: ">Heb. אַפֵּ. I cannot explain this to mean a nose, either in reference to its simple meaning or in reference to its allegorical meaning, for what praise of beauty is there in a nose that is large and erect as a tower? I say, therefore, that אַפֵּ means a face. Now the reason he uses the singular and does not say אַפַּיִ, is that he speaks of the forehead, which is the main recognizable feature of the face, as it is said (Isa. 3:9): “The recognition of their faces testified against them.” And you should know, for he progressively praises them from bottom to top “ -Your eyes are [like] pools in Heshbon,” and after them the forehead, and so do the nations praise (Ezek. 3:8): “and your forehead is strong against” the forehead of all who come to harm you and entice you.</text>
      <text title="as the tower of Lebanon, facing towards Damascus: ">I saw [the following] in the Midrash (Zuta): This is the house of the Lebanon forest, which King Solomon made. Whoever stood on it could look and count how many houses there were in Damascus. Another explanation: Your face looks towards Damascus; looks forward to the coming of the gates of Jerusalem until Damascus, for it is destined to expand as far as Damascus.</text>

      <text title="and the braided locks of your head: ">The braided hair of your Nazirites are as beautiful with commandments as braided purple [ropes].</text>

      <text title="tresses: ">Heb. רְהָטִים, courants in French; currents, windings [tresses]. This is what they call the fringes of the sashes, with which they tie the girdles.
