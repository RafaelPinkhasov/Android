<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and some of the vessels of the House of God into his hand, and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought to the treasury of his god.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Then the king said to Ashpenaz, his chief officer, to bring from the Children of Israel, from the royal seed, and from the nobles.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Youths in whom there is no blemish, of handsome appearance, who understand all wisdom, [who are] erudite in knowledge, who understand how to express their thoughts, and who have strength to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the script and the language of the Chaldeans.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The king allotted them a daily portion of the king's food and of the wine that he drank, and to train them for three years, and at the end thereof, they would stand before the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Now there were among them, from the Judahites, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the chief officer gave them names: he called Daniel Belteshazzar, Hananiah Shadrach, Mishael Meshach, and Azariah Abed-nego.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Daniel resolved not to be defiled by the king's food or by the wine he drank; so he requested of the king's chief officer that he should not be defiled.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">God granted Daniel kindness and mercy before the chief officer.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the chief officer replied to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who allotted your food and your drink, for why should he see your faces troubled more than the youths like you? And you will forfeit my head to the king."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Daniel answered the steward whom the chief officer had appointed for Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">"Now test your servants for ten days, and let them give us some pulse that we should eat, and water that we should drink.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be seen by you, and as you will see, so do with your servants."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">He heeded them in this matter and tested them for ten days.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And at the end of the ten days, they looked handsomer and fatter than all the youths who ate the king's food.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the steward would carry away their food and the wine they were to drink and give them pulse.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And to these youths, the four of them, God gave knowledge and understanding in every script and wisdom, and Daniel understood all visions and dreams.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And at the end of the days that the king ordered to bring them, the chief officer brought them before Nebuchadnezzar.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the king spoke with them, and of all of them, no one was found to equal Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; and they stood before the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And in every matter of the wisdom of understanding that the king requested of them, he found them ten times better than all the necromancers and astrologers in all his kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep was interrupted.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the king commanded to summon the necromancers, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams, and they came and stood before the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the king said to them, "I dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, "May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we shall tell the interpretation."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The king replied and said to the Chaldeans, "The matter has escaped me. If you do not let me know the dream and its meaning, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be made into a dungheap.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">But if you tell the dream and its meaning, you will receive gifts and lavish presents and great honor from me; but tell me the dream and its meaning."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">They replied a second time and said, "Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we shall tell the meaning."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The king replied and said, "In truth, I know that this time you are doomed because you see that the matter has escaped me.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For if you do not tell me the dream, there is but one law for you, or if you have prepared yourselves to say before me a false and corrupt word, until the time changes . but tell me the dream, and I shall know that you will tell me its meaning."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The Chaldeans replied before the king and said, "There is no man on the earth who can declare the king's word; because no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any necromancer, astrologer, or Chaldean.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the matter that the king asks is difficult, and there is no other who can tell it before the king but the angels, whose dwelling is not with people."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">In view of this, the king was in great wrath and anger and ordered to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And a decree was issued, and the wise men were being slain, and Daniel and his colleagues were sought to be slain.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Then Daniel answered with counsel and good sense to Arioch, the king's chief executioner, who had gone out to slay the wise men of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">He replied and said to Arioch, the king's ruler, "Why was the decree issued so hastily from before the king?" Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then Daniel entered and requested of the king that time be given him, and the interpretation would be told to the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Then Daniel went home and let his colleagues, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, know of the matter.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And to pray and beg of the God of heaven about this secret, that Daniel and his colleagues should not perish with the remaining wise men of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in the vision of the night; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Daniel spoke up and said, "May the Name of God be blessed from everlasting even to everlasting, to Whom are wisdom and might.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And He changes the times and the seasons, He removes kings and sets up kings; He grants wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who know understanding.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">He reveals the profound and secret things; He knows what is in the dark, and light dwells with Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">To You, O God of my forefathers, I give thanks and praise, for You have given me wisdom and might, and now You have let me know what I requested of You, for the matter of the king You have let me know."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">In view of this, Daniel came in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went, and so he said to him, "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Bring me in before the king, and I shall tell the king the interpretation."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Then Arioch brought Daniel in before the king in haste, and so he said to him, that "I have found a man of the exiles of Judea who will let the king know the interpretation."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">The king spoke up and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Do you have the ability to tell me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?"</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Daniel answered the king and said, "The secret that the king asks, no wise men, astrologers, necromancers, or demonologists can tell the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">But there is a God in heaven Who reveals secrets, and He lets King Nebuchadnezzar know what will be at the end of days; that is your dream and the visions of your head on your bed.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">You, O king, your thoughts came while on your bed, what will be after this, and the Revealer of secrets lets you know what will be.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And I-not with wisdom that I possess more than all living, did He reveal this secret to me, but in order that they should let the king know the interpretation, and you should know the thoughts of your heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">O King, you were watching, and behold, one great image, an image which had a large base and with unusual splendor, was standing opposite you, and its form was frightening.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">That image had a head of fine gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its belly and thighs were of copper.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Its legs were of iron, and its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">You were watching until one stone was hewn without hands, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and crumbled them.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">Then the iron, the clay, the copper, the silver, and the gold crumbled together, and they were like chaff from the threshing floors of the summer, and the wind carried them off, and no place was found for them, and the stone that struck the image became a huge mountain and filled the entire earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">This is the dream, and its interpretation we shall recite before the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">You, O King, the King of kings, the God of heaven gave you a strong, powerful, and prominent kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And wherever people, wild beasts, and birds of the sky dwell, He has given into your hand and has given you dominion over them all. You are the head of gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And after you will arise another kingdom lower than you, and another-a third kingdom- of copper, which will rule over the entire earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And a fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, for iron crumbles and flattens everything, and like iron, which shatters all these, it will crumble and shatter.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And what you saw, the feet and the toes-which were partly of potter's clay and partly of iron-so it will be a divided kingdom, and in it will be some of the strength of iron, in view of what you saw iron mixed with clay.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, for part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be broken.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And what you saw, iron mixed with clay, [connotes] that they will mingle with the seed of men, but they will not cleave one to the other, as iron does not mix with clay.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And in the days of these kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom forever, it will not be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left to another people; it will crumble and destroy all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="45">Just as you saw that from the mountain a stone was hewn without hands, and it crumbled the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has let the king know what will be after this, and the dream is true, and its interpretation is reliable."</pasuk><pasuk id="46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and prostrated himself before Daniel, and he ordered to offer up a meal-offering and libations to bring him satisfaction.</pasuk><pasuk id="47">The king replied to Daniel and said, "Truly, your God is the God of the gods and the Master of the kings, and He reveals secrets, being that you were able to reveal this secret.</pasuk><pasuk id="48">Then the king elevated Daniel and gave him many great gifts and gave him dominion over all the capital cities of Babylon, and he was the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="49">And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed, over the affairs of the capital cities of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; and Daniel was in the king's gate.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, its height sixty cubits, its width six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the capital city of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the capital cities to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Then, the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the capital cities were gathered to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they were standing opposite the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the announcement was issued aloud, "To you we are saying O peoples, nations and tongues.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">At the time that you hear the sound of the whistling horn, the clavichord, the harp, the psaltery, the bagpipes, and all kinds of music, you shall fall and prostrate yourselves to the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And whoever will not fall and prostrate himself, will at that time be cast into a burning, fiery furnace."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">In view of this, at that time, when all peoples heard the sound of the whistling horn, the clavichord, the harp, the psaltery, and all kinds of music, all peoples, nations, and tongues would prostrate themselves to the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">In view of this, at that time, some Chaldean men approached and denounced the Jews.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">They spoke up and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "May the king live forever!</pasuk><pasuk id="10">You, O king, gave an order that any person who hears the sound of the whistling horn, the clavichord, the harp, the psaltery, the bagpipes, and all kinds of music, shall fall and prostrate himself to the golden image.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And whoever does not fall and prostrate himself shall be cast into the fiery furnace.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">There are Judahite men whom you appointed over the affairs of the capital cities of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men did not take counsel to follow your decree, O king. They do not worship your god and they do not prostrate themselves to the golden image that you have set up."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar, in wrath and anger, ordered to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then these men were brought before the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Nebuchadnezzar spoke up and said to them, "Is it [my decree] meaningless, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you do not worship my god and that you do not prostrate yourselves to the golden image that I have set up?"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now behold, you are destined, at the time that you hear the whistling horn, the clavichord, the harp, the psaltery, the bagpipes, and all kinds of music, to fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made, and if you do not prostrate yourselves, at that time you shall be cast into a burning, fiery furnace, and who is a god who will save you from my hand?</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, "Nebuchadnezzar, we do not care to answer you about this matter.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Behold there is our God whom we worship; He can save us. From the burning, fiery furnace and from your hands, O king, He will save [us].</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not worship your god, neither will we prostrate ourselves to the golden image that you have set up."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the features of his face changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; he shouted and ordered to heat the furnace seven times as much as it should be heated.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he commanded certain mighty men in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, to cast them into the burning, fiery furnace.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their trousers, their robes, and their [other] garments, and they were cast into the burning, fiery furnace.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">In view of this, since the word of the king was urgent and the furnace was heated excessively, these men who had brought up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were killed by a spark of fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell into the burning, fiery furnace, bound.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Then King Nebuchadnezzar was bewildered and stood up in haste. He shouted and said to his leaders, "Did I not cast three men into the fiery furnace, bound?" They answered and said to the king, "The king is true."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">He called out and said, "Behold, I see four free men walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no wound upon them, and the form of the fourth one is like [that of] an angel."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the gate of the burning, fiery furnace. He shouted and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, the servants of the Most High God! Step out and come!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the leaders of the king gathered [and] saw these men, that the fire had taken no effect on their bodies, the hair of their heads was not singed, their robes had not changed, and the smell of fire had not been absorbed by them.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Nebuchadnezzar cried out and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, Who sent His angel and rescued His servants, who trusted Him, deviated from the command of the king, and risked their lives in order not to worship or prostrate themselves to any god except to their God.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Now an order is issued by me that any people, nation, or tongue that will speak amiss about the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and his house shall be made a dungheap because there is no other god who can save in this manner."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego prosper in the capital city of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">King Nebuchadnezzar, [said] to all peoples, nations, and tongues that dwell in the whole earth, "May your welfare increase!</pasuk><pasuk id="32">The signs and wonders that the Most High God has done with me it behooves me to recite.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">How great are His signs, and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion is with every generation."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was tranquil in my house and flourishing in my palace.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">I saw a dream, and it frightened me, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my mind terrified me.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So I issued an order to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they should let me know the meaning of the dream.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Then the necromancers, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the demonologists entered, and I related my dream to them, but they did not tell me its meaning.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Until, at last, Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, like the name of my god, entered before me, in whom is the spirit of holy angels, and I told him the dream.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">"O Belteshazzar, head of the necromancers, since I know that the spirit of holy angels is in you, and no secret is hidden from you, [this is] the vision of my dream that I saw; now tell me its interpretation.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And [these are] the visions of my mind [that I had] on my bed; I was looking, and behold [there was] a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was tremendous.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The tree grew and became strong, and its height reached the sky, and its appearance [was seen] to the end of all the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Its branches were beautiful and its fruit was plentiful, and on it was sustenance for all. Under it, the beasts of the field took shade, and in its branches dwelt the birds of the heavens, and all flesh was nourished from it.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">I saw in the visions of my mind on my bed, and behold a wakeful holy one descended from the heavens.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Crying out loudly, and so he said, "Cut down the tree and cut off its branches, shake off its branches and scatter its fruit; the beasts shall wander away from beneath it and the birds from its branches.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But leave its main roots in the ground, and in fetters of iron and copper in the grass of the field, and with the dew of the heavens it shall be drenched, and with the beasts shall be its lot in the grass of the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">They will change his heart from a man's, and the heart of a beast will be given him, and seven periods will pass over him.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">By the decree of the wakeful ones is the matter and by the word of the holy ones is the edict, in order that the living should know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of man, and to whom He wishes He gives it, and the lowest of men He sets upon it.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen, and you, Belteshazzar, tell [me] its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom cannot let me know the interpretation, but you can, because the spirit of holy angels is in you."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was bewildered for awhile, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king spoke up and said, "Belteshazzar, let the dream and its interpretation not alarm you." Belteshazzar answered and said, "My lord, may the dream be for your enemies and its interpretation for your foes.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, and whose height reached the sky, and whose appearance [was seen] by the entire earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And whose branches were beautiful, and whose fruit was plentiful, and on which was sustenance for all, under which dwelt the beasts of the field, and in whose branches dwelt the birds of the heavens.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">That is you, O king, for you have become great and strong, and your greatness has increased and reached the heaven and your dominion [extends] to the end of the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And what the king saw-a holy wakeful one descending from heaven, and he said, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave its main roots in the ground, and [chain him] with fetters of iron and copper in the grass of the field, and with the dew of the heavens he shall be drenched, and with the beasts of the fields shall be his lot, until seven periods pass over him.'</pasuk><pasuk id="21">This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which befalls my lord, the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they will banish you from mankind, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they will feed you grass like the cattle, and with the dew of the heavens you shall be drenched, and seven periods shall pass over you until you know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men, and to whom He wishes He gives it.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And what they said to leave, the main roots of the tree, your kingdom will remain yours, as soon as you know that Heaven rules.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Indeed, O king, may my counsel please you, and with charity you will remove your sin and your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor; perhaps your tranquility will last."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">All this befell King Nebuchadnezzar.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">At the end of twelve months, he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">The king raised his voice and said, "Is this not the great Babylon, which I built for a royal palace with the strength of my power and for the honor of my glory?"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">The word was still in the king's mouth, [when] a voice fell from heaven, [which said] "To you they said 'O King Nebuchadnezzar, your kingdom has turned away from you.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">From man they will banish you, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field; like cattle, they will feed you grass, and seven periods will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of man, and to whom He wishes, He gives it."'</pasuk><pasuk id="30">At that time, the matter was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was banished from man, he ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of the heavens, until his hair grew like [the feathers of] eagles and his nails like [the claws of] birds.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my understanding was restored to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified Him Who lives to Eternity, Whose dominion is an eternal dominion, and Whose kingdom is with every generation.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reckoned as nothing, and according to His will, He foes with the host of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth, and no one can stop His hand or say to Him, "What have You done?"</pasuk><pasuk id="33">At that time, my understanding was restored to me, and I returned to the glory of my kingdom, and my splendor was restored to me; and my leaders and my dignitaries were seeking me, and I was established upon my kingship and excessive greatness was added to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, Whose works are all true and Whose ways are just and Who can humble those who walk with arrogance.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">King Belshazzar made a great feast for his one thousand dignitaries, and he drank as much wine as the thousand.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Belshazzar said, with the counsel of the wine, to bring the golden and silver vessels that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple that was in Jerusalem, that the king, his dignitaries, his queen, and his concubines should drink from them.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Then the golden vessels that they had taken out of the Temple of the House of God, which was in Jerusalem, were brought, and the king, his dignitaries, his queen, and his concubines drank from them.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">They drank wine and praised gods of gold, silver, copper, iron, wood, and stone.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">At that time, the fingers of a human hand emerged and wrote opposite the candelabrum on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, and the king saw the palm of the hand that was writing.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Then the king-his color changed, and his thoughts frightened him, the belts of his loins became untied, and his knees knocked one against the other.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">The king cried aloud to bring in the necromancers, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king shouted and said to the wise men of Babylon, "Any man who shall read this writing and tell me its interpretation shall wear purple and [have] a golden chain on his neck and rule over a third of the kingdom."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Then all the king's wise men entered, but they could not read the writing or let the king know its interpretation.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Then King Belshazzar became very frightened, and his color changed, and his dignitaries were perplexed.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The queen, in response to the words of the king and his dignitaries, entered the banquet hall; the queen raised her voice and said, "May the king live forever! Let your thoughts not frighten you, and let your color not change.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of holy angels, and in your father's time enlightenment, understanding, and wisdom like the wisdom of the angels was found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, appointed him prince of the necromancers, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the demonologists; [so did] your father the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">All because a superior spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, tell riddles, and untie knots was found in him, in Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar; now let Daniel be summoned and he will tell the interpretation."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king raised his voice and said to Daniel, "You are Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judea, whom my father brought from Judea.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And I heard about you that the spirit of the angels is in you, and enlightenment, understanding, and superior wisdom is found in you.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they may read this writing and let me know its interpretation, but they cannot interpret the matter to tell [it].</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And I have heard about you that you can interpret interpretations and untie knots. Now if you can read the writing and let me know its interpretation, you shall wear purple and [have] a golden chain on your neck, and [over] a third of the kingdom you shall rule."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Then Daniel raised his voice and said before the king, "Keep your gifts for yourself, and give your lavish gifts to someone else, but I shall read the writing for the king, and I shall let him know the interpretation.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">You are the king [because] the Most High God gave your father, Nebuchadnezzar, kingdom, greatness, honor, and glory.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And through the greatness that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and tongues were quaking, and they feared him; whomever he wished he would slay, and whomever he wished he would let live; whomever he wished he would exalt, and whomever he wished he would humble.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And when his heart became haughty and his spirit was toughened so that he dealt wickedly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and the honor was removed from him.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he was banished from mankind, and his heart was just like that of the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses. They fed him grass like the cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of the heavens, until he realized that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of man, and whomever He wishes He sets up on it.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">But you, his son, Belshazzar, you did not humble your heart in view of the fact that you know all this.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">But over the Lord of heaven you exalted yourself, and the vessels of His House they brought before you, and you, your dignitaries, your queen, and your concubines drank wine in them, and you praised gods of silver and gold, copper, iron, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor know, but the God in Whose hand is your soul and all your ways-He you did not glorify.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Then from before Him the palm of a hand was sent forth, and it inscribed this writing.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And this is the writing that it inscribed: MENE MENE TEKEIL UFARSIN.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE-God has counted your kingdom and has brought it to an end.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">TEKEIL-You were weighed on the scales and found wanting.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">UFARSIN-Your kingdom has been broken up and given to Media and Persia."</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Then Belshazzar ordered, and they attired Daniel with purple and the golden chain on his neck, and they announced about him that he should rule over a third of the kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">On that very night, Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was assassinated.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">It pleased Darius, and he set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, who should be in the entire kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And over them three viziers, one of which was Daniel, that these satraps should give them counsel, and the king should not suffer any injury.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Then this Daniel surpassed the viziers and the satraps because he had a superior spirit, and the king contemplated setting him up over the entire kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Then the viziers and the satraps sought to find a pretext against Daniel regarding the kingdom, but they could find no pretext or fault because he was trustworthy, and no error or fault was found about him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Then those men said, "No pretext can be found about Daniel, but we shall find [a pretext] against him concerning the law of his God."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Then these viziers and satraps assembled about the king, and so they said to him: "O King Darius, may you live forever!</pasuk><pasuk id="8">All the viziers of the kingdom, the prefects, the satraps, the leaders, and the governors have taken counsel to preserve the king's law and to strengthen a decree that whoever makes any request of any god or man until thirty days except from you, O king, shall be cast into a pit of lions.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Now, O king, you shall issue a decree and inscribe a writ that will not be amended, like the law of Media and Persia, which will not be repealed."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">In view of this, King Darius inscribed a writ and a decree.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Daniel, when he knew that a writ had been inscribed, came to his house, where there were open windows in his upper chamber, opposite Jerusalem, and three times a day he kneeled on his knees and prayed and offered thanks before his God just as he had done prior to this.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Then these men searched and found Daniel begging and supplicating before his God.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Then they drew near and said before the king concerning the king's decree, "Did you not issue a decree that any person who begs from any god or man for thirty days except from you, O king, shall be cast into the pit of the lions?" The king replied and said, "The thing is true as the law of Media and Persia, which shall not be repealed."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Then they raised their voices and said before the king that "Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judea, did not pay heed to you, O king, or to the decree that you inscribed, and three times a day he offers up his prayer."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Then, when the king heard the thing, he became very displeased, and he gave Daniel a reprieve to save him, and until sunset, he tried to save him.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then these men gathered to the king and said to the king, "You should know, O king, that the law of Media and Persia is that any decree or statute that the king establishes cannot be altered."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Then the king ordered, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the pit of the lions. The king raised his voice and said to Daniel, "May your God, Whom you serve regularly, save you!"</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And a stone was brought and placed on the mouth of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet ring of his dignitaries that his will about Daniel not be altered.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Then the king went to his palace and retired while fasting, and no table was brought before him, and his sleep wandered from him.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Then the king at dawn arose to the light of morning, and in haste went to the pit of the lions.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And when he approached the pit, he cried out to Daniel with a sad voice. The king raised his voice and said to Daniel, "Daniel, servant of the living God, the God Whom you worship regularly-was He able to save you from the lions?"</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Then Daniel spoke with the king, [and said:] "May the king live forever!</pasuk><pasuk id="23">My God sent His angel, and he closed the mouths of the lions and they did not hurt me because a merit was found for me before Him, and also before you, O king, I have done no harm."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Then it pleased the king exceedingly, and he ordered to lift Daniel up out of the pit, and Daniel was lifted up out of the pit, and no injury was found on him because he believed in his God.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And the king ordered, and they brought these men, who had informed on Daniel, and they were cast into the lions' pit-they, their sons, and their wives, and they did not reach the bottom of the pit before the lions overwhelmed them and crushed their bones into fine particles.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, nations, and tongues that lived in all the land, "May your peace increase!</pasuk><pasuk id="27">From before me an order is issued that in the entire dominion of my kingdom, [everyone] should quake and be awestricken before the God of Daniel, for He is a living God, He exists forever, and His kingdom will not be destroyed, nor will His dominion until the end.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">He saves and rescues and performs signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, Who saved Daniel from the hands of the lions."</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And this Daniel prospered in the [time of the] kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">In the first year of Belshazzar, the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and the visions of his mind [while asleep] on his bed; then he wrote the dream and said the beginnings of the matters.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Daniel raised his voice and said: I saw in my vision during the night, and behold the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the Great Sea.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And four huge beasts were coming up out of the sea, each one different from the other.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle, until its wings were plucked and it was taken from the earth, and it stood on feet like a man, and the heart of a mortal was given it.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And behold another second beast, resembling a bear, and it stood to one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth, and so did they say to it, 'Get up, eat much meat.'</pasuk><pasuk id="6">After this, I saw, and behold another one, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back, and the beast had four heads, and dominion was given it.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">After this, I saw in the visions of the night, and behold a fourth beast, awesome and dreadful and exceedingly strong, and it had huge iron teeth. It ate and crushed, and trampled the rest with its feet, and it was different from all the beasts that were before me, and it had ten horns.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">I looked at these horns and behold another small horn came up among them, and three of the first horns were plucked out before it, and behold eyes like human eyes were on this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">I was looking until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days sat; His raiment was as white as snow, and the hair of His head was like clean wool; His throne was sparks of fire, its wheels were a burning fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">A river of fire was flowing and emerging from before Him; a thousand thousands served Him, and ten thousand ten thousands arose before Him. Justice was established, and the books were opened.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">I saw then from the sound of the arrogant words that the horn spoke, I looked until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to a flame of fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But as for the other beasts, their dominion was removed, and they were given an extension of life until a set time.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">I saw in the visions of the night, and behold with the clouds of the heaven, one like a man was coming, and he came up to the Ancient of Days and was brought before Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And He gave him dominion and glory and a kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and tongues shall serve him; his dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not be removed, and his kingdom is one which will not be destroyed.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">My spirit-I, Daniel-became troubled within its sheath, and the visions of my mind terrified me.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">I drew near to one of those standing [there], and I asked him the truth of all this, and he told it to me, and he let me know the interpretation of the matters.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">[He said] "These huge beasts, which are four, are four kingdoms, which will arise from the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the high holy ones will receive the kingdom, and they will inherit the kingdom forever and to all eternity."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Then I wished to determine the truth of the fourth beast, which was different from all of them- excessively dreadful; its teeth were of iron and its nails of copper; it ate and crushed to powder, and the rest it trampled with its feet.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other one that came up and [the] three [that] fell before it, and the horn that was like this and that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly, and its appearance was greater than [that of] its companions.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">I looked and the horn that was like this waged war with the holy ones and overwhelmed them.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Until the Ancient of Days came and gave revenge to the high holy ones, and the time arrived that the holy ones inherited the kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">So he said, "The fourth beast [represents] a fourth kingdom [that] will be on the earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms, and it will devour the whole land and trample it and crush it.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the ten horns that [sprout] from that kingdom [represent] ten kings [that] will rise, and the last one will rise after them, and he will be different from the first, and he will humble three kings.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And he will speak words against the Most High, and he will oppress the high holy ones, and he will think to change the times and the law, and they will be delivered into his hand until a time, two times, and half a time.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the judgment shall be established, and they will remove his dominion to be destroyed and annihilated until the end.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under all the heavens will be given to the people of the high holy ones; its kingdom is a perpetual kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey [it]."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Until here is the end of the matter.
