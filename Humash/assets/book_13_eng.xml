Your sword devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">O generation, you see the word of the Lord. Was I a desert to Israel or a land of thick darkness? Why have My people said, "We have been separated; we will no longer come to You"?</pasuk><pasuk id="32">Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her ribbons? Yet My people have forgotten Me for countless days.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">How you adorn your way to seek love! Verily, even to the most evil you accustomed your ways.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor; you did not find them breaking in, but for all these.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And you said, "But I am innocent, surely His wrath has gone away from me." Behold, I contend with you concerning because you say, "I have not sinned."</pasuk><pasuk id="36">How you degrade yourself exceedingly to change your way! You shall also be ashamed through Egypt as you were ashamed through Assyria.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">Also from this one shall you go out with your hands on your head, for the Lord has despised those whom you trust, and you shall not prosper through them.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">[I have] to say; If a man sends away his wife, and she goes away from him, and marries another man, may he return to her again?

By the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the desert, and you defiled the land with your harlotries and with your evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the rains were withheld, and there has been no latter rain, and you had a harlot's forehead; you refused to be ashamed.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Will you not from this time call me, "My Father, You the Master of my youth."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Will He bear a grudge forever? Will He keep it to eternity? Behold, you have spoken, and you have committed evil things, and you were able.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the Lord said to me in the days of King Josiah: Have you seen what the backsliding Israel has done? She goes on every lofty mountain and under every leafy tree, and she played the harlot there.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I said after she had done all these things: She shall return to Me. But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw [it].</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And I saw, because of all that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I sent her away, and I gave her her bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, did not fear, and she too went and played the harlot.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it was through the lightness of her harlotry, that she polluted the land, and she committed adultery with the stones and the wood.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And yet for all this, her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but falsely, says the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the Lord said to me; Backsliding Israel has proven herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Go and proclaim these words to the north, and say; Return, O backsliding Israel, says the Lord.

Your children have forsaken Me, and they swore by no-gods. Here I sated them and they committed adultery, and they banded together in the house of a harlot.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Like armed stallions, they would arise early; they would neigh, each one over his friend's wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Shall I not punish for these things? says the Lord, or for a nation such as this shall My soul not wreak vengeance?</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Ascend upon its rows and destroy, but make no complete end; remove its roots, for they are not the Lord's.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt treacherously with Me, says the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">They denied the Lord and said, "It is not He, and no evil will befall us, neither will we see sword or famine.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the prophets shall become wind, for there is no speech in them." So shall be done to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Therefore, so says the Lord God of Hosts, because you have spoken this word. Behold I put My words into your mouth as fire, and this people [shall be wood] and it shall consume them.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Behold I bring upon you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, says the Lord; it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you will not know, and you will not understand what he will speak.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">His quiver is like an open grave, all of them are mighty men.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he will devour your harvest and your bread; they will devour your sons and your daughters; he will devour your flocks and your cattle; he will devour your vines and your fig trees; he will impoverish your fortified cities upon which you rely, with the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And also in those days, says the Lord, I will not make an end to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And it will be that you will say, "For what reason has the Lord our God done all these to us?" you shall say to them: As you have forsaken Me and worshipped foreign gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers in a land not yours.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Tell this in the house of Jacob and make it heard in Judah, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Hearken to this, foolish people without understanding; they have eyes yet they see not, they have ears yet they hear not.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Will you not fear Me? says the Lord, or, do you not quake from before Me, for I made sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass, and [its waves] toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail; and its waves roar, but they do not pass it.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And this people had a revolting and rebellious heart; they turned away and they were gone.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they did not say in their heart, "Let us now fear the Lord our God, Who gives rain, the early rain and the latter rain in its time, the weeks of the laws of harvest He keeps for us."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Your iniquities have brought these about, and your sins have withheld the good from you.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">For wicked men are found in My people; they lie in wait as a trap bites; they station an ambush, they catch people.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">As a cage is full, so are their houses full of deceit; therefore, they have become great and they have become rich.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">They have become fat, they have become thick; also they transgress in deeds of wickedness; they did not plead the cause of an orphan that they prosper, and the judgment of the poor they did not judge.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Shall I not punish for these? says the Lord, or for such a nation shall My soul not take vengeance?</pasuk><pasuk id="30">An appalling and horrible thing has come about in the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">The prophets have prophesied falsely, and the priests govern after them, and My people love to have it so. Now what shall you do in the end thereof?</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">Gather the sons of Benjamin from the midst of Jerusalem, and in Tekoa sound the shofar, and over Beth-hakerem raise a standard, for evil is visible from the north and a great calamity.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The comely and the delicate one have I destroyed, O daughter of Zion.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Shepherds and their flocks shall come to her, they have pitched tents around her, they feed bare, each one in his place.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Prepare war against her, arise and let us go up at noontime; woe is to us for the day has passed, for the shadows of evening are stretched out.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Arise and let us go up at night and let us destroy her palaces.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For so says the Lord of Hosts: Cut the trees and cast on Jerusalem a siege mound; that is the city whose sins have been visited upon her, everywhere there is oppression in its midst.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">As a well lets its water flow, so has she let her evil flow; violence and spoil is heard therein before Me continually; sickness and wounds.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Be corrected, O Jerusalem, lest My soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land uninhabited.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So says the Lord of Hosts: They shall thoroughly glean like a vine the remnant of Israel; return your hand as a vintager over the branches.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">To whom shall I speak and warn that they shall hearken? Behold, their ear is clogged, and they cannot listen; behold, the word of the Lord was a disgrace to them, they desire it not.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Therefore, I am full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary of containing it, to pour it out upon the babes in the street and upon the assembly of young men together, for a man with a woman shall be seized, an old man with one full of days.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And their houses shall be turned over to others, fields and wives together, for I will stretch out My hand over the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">For, from their smallest to their greatest, they all commit robbery, and from prophet to priest they all deal falsely.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And they healed the breach of My people easily, saying, "Peace, peace," but there is no peace.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">They shall be put to shame since they have committed abomination. Neither are they ashamed nor do they know to feel disgrace.

kings, their officers, their priests, and their prophets, and the people of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And they turned their backs to Me and not their faces; although I taught them, teaching them betimes, they do not hearken to receive instruction.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And they placed their abominations in the house upon which My Name was called, to contaminate it.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And they built the high places of Baal, which was in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to pass their sons and their daughters to Molech, which I neither commanded them nor did it enter My mind to commit this abomination, in order to bring guilt upon Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And now, therefore, so said the Lord God of Israel concerning this city which you say, "It has been given into the hand[s] of the king of Babylon by the sword and by famine and by pestilence";</pasuk><pasuk id="37">Behold I will gather them from all the lands where I have driven them with My anger and with My wrath and with great fury, and I will restore them to this place and I will cause them to dwell safely.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And I will give them one accord and one way to fear Me all the time, so that it be good for them and for their children after them.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And I will form for them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, and My fear I will place in their heart, not to turn away from Me.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And I will rejoice over them to do good to them, and I will plant them in this land truly with all My heart and with all My soul.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">For so said the Lord: As I have brought upon this people all this great evil, so will I bring upon them all the good that I speak concerning them.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And the field shall be bought in this land, which you say, "It is desolate without man or beast; it has been given into the hand[s] of the Chaldeans."</pasuk><pasuk id="44">Men shall buy fields for money and inscribe deeds and sign [them] and appoint witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the mountain and in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the southland, for I will restore their captivity, says the Lord.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="33"><pasuk id="1">And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still confined in the prison yard, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">So said the

sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">They come to war with the Chaldeans and to fill them with the corpses of the men whom I have smitten with My anger and with My wrath, and that which I have hidden My face from this city because of all their evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Behold, I will bring it healing and cure, and I will cure them, and I will reveal to them a greeting of peace and truth.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I will return the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel, and build them up like at first.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And I will purify them of all their iniquity that they sinned against Me, and I will forgive all their iniquities that they sinned against Me and that they rebelled against Me.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it shall be to Me for a name of joy, for praise and for glory to all the nations of the earth who will hear all the good that I do for them and fear and tremble because of all the good and because of all the peace that I do for it.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">So said the Lord: There shall again be heard in this place, concerning which you say, "It is desolate without man and without beast," in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without a man and without an inhabitant and without a beast,</pasuk><pasuk id="11">the sound of mirth and the sound of joy, the voice of a bridegroom and the voice of a bride, the sound of those saying, "Thank the Lord of Hosts, for the Lord is good, for His loving-kindness endures forever," bringing a thanksgiving offering to the House of the Lord, for I will restore the captivity of the land as at first, said the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">So said the Lord of Hosts: There shall again be in this place that is waste without man or beast, and in all its cities a dwelling of shepherds resting [their] flocks.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the Negev and in the land of Benjamin and in the environs of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of one who counts them, said the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, and I will establish the good thing that I spoke concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">In those days and in that time I will cause to grow for David a plant of righteousness, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">In those days, Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely and this is the name that He shall call it, the Lord is our righteousness.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For so said the Lord: There shall not be cut off from David a man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And of the Levitic priests, there shall not be cut off from before Me a man offering up a burnt offering, or burning a meal-offering or performing a sacrifice for all time.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="20">So said the Lord: If you break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, and not to have day and night in their time.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Also My covenant with David shall be broken, that he should not have a son reigning on his throne, and with the Levitic priests, My ministers.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Just as the host of heaven cannot be counted nor can the sand of the sea be measured, so will I increase the seed of My servant David and the Levites who minister to Me.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Have you not seen what this people has spoken saying: The two families that God chose, He has rejected, and they make My people despise being a nation any longer before them.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">So said the Lord: If not My covenant with the day and the night, that the statutes of heaven and earth I did not place,</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Also will I reject the seed of Jacob and David, My servant, not to take from his seed rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, when I bring back their captivity and have mercy upon them.</pasuk></chapter><chapter
