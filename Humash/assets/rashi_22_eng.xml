      <text title="The prophecy: ">Heb. הַמַשָּׂא. The burden of prophecy - what he bore and received by the Holy Spirit. [after Jonathan]</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="O Lord! How long: ">He foresaw with the Holy Spirit that Nebuchadnezzar was destined to be the ruler of the world and to cause trouble for Israel, as the matter is stated in his prophecy (1:6): “For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, etc.” He was complaining for this.</text>
      <text title="I cry out to You of violence: ">I mention before You the violence committed against me, and You do not save me.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="iniquity: ">plunder and violence.</text>
      <text title="and look upon mischief: ">You look upon this mischief, but You do not help.</text>
      <text title="and the one who bears quarrel and strife endures: ">And this wicked man who bears quarrel and strife, will live, remain in existence, and prosper.</text>
      <text title="endures: ">He who bears quarrel and strife will endure. So did Jonathan render.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="Therefore Torah is slackened: ">Because of this, that Israel sees his [the wicked man’s] success, the Torah will slacken and leave them; and they [Israel] will obey him [the wicked man] and prostrate themselves before the idol in the valley of Dura.</text>
      <text title="and justice does not go out forever: ">I.e., the true decision of the Law.</text>
      <text title="surrounds: ">surrounds, as in (Ps. 22:13): “Strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded me (כִּתְּרוּנִי).”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="5">
      <text title="You shall not believe when it is told: ">When this is told to you, that I am setting up the Chaldeans, the people that did not deserve to be created, as it is written (Isa. 23:13): “This people has never been.” They are one of three things whose creation God regrets, and now [they] will rise, and [they] will be bitter, and [they will be] impetuous to run and to march to the breadth of the lands of all the nations.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="from themselves their judgment and their burden shall emanate: ">From them are judges; from them are kings, who cast a burden and a fear upon all.</text>
      <text title="their judgment: ">joustice in O.F:</text>

    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="and their riders shall increase: ">Heb. וּפָשוּ.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="come to commit violence: ">to plunder and to spoil.</text>
      <text title="the eagerness of their faces: ">an expression like (Gen. 24: 17) “Give me to swallow, (הַגְמִיאִינִי) I pray you” and (Job 39:24) “He swallows (י ְגַמֶּה) the earth.” He runs swiftly - in a short time a distance of a day’s plowing - as though he had swallowed and drunk the earth that is before him. Here, too, the swallowing of their faces; the swallowing, the longing of their faces resembles the east wind, the fiercest of the winds. So did Jonathan render this.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="10">
      <text title="And they shall mock the kings: ">shall mock them. Every expression of ק ַלָּסָה is an expression for the speech of those speaking about another; some [of these speeches] are for good, and some for bad - parledic in O.F.</text>
      <text title="a laughingstock: ">like שְּׂחוֹק, laughter, like מִשְׁמָר, a watch, and מִסְתָּר, a hiding place.</text>
      <text title="He shall scoff at every fortress: ">If his enemy is in a strong fortress, he scoffs at him.</text>
      <text title="he piles up earth: ">upon it with his many armies, each one carrying a load of earth. It [the pile] is before the wall as a high mound, and they [the Chaldeans] battle from upon it. This is called שְׁפִיכַתסוֹלְלָה, pouring a siege mound (cf. Isa. 37:33), for all of them are translated into Aramaic: וְיִצְבּוֹר עֲלָה מְלֵיתָא, and he piled upon it a filling. This is an expression of Milo, for in the city of David there was a high mound, and they would battle upon it. Atop the mound was built a tower whose slant was inclined to the sides, and around its base was a low wall to prevent the earth from falling.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="11">
      <text title="Then a spirit goes further: ">Then, when they see their way prospering, a spirit of guilt goes further and passes over them. Now what is the spirit?</text>
      <text title="this strength they attribute to their god: ">This strength they attribute to their god, and they say, “My god acquired all this wealth for me.” Says the prophet, “Now, You, why should You remain silent to all this?”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="12">
      <text title="Are You not from everlasting, O Lord, my God, my Holy One?: ">Who shall not die. Now, the reason it is written לֹא נָמוּת we shall not die, is that it is one of the emendations of the scribes in Scripture, by which Scripture euphemizes. Likewise, (Mal. 1:13) “And you sadden it.” And so are many of them [these euphemisms] explained in Sifre (Num. 10:35). According to the emendation of the scribes, this is its explanation: Are you not my God from everlasting, my Holy One? Do not deliver us into their hands to die.</text>
      <text title="O Lord, You have ordained them for judgment: ">I know that You have set this one [Nebuchadnezzar] up only to judge those who rebel against You. In any case, why should all this come about? Is it not so that…</text>

    <pasuk id="15">
      <text title="He takes all of them up with the fishhook: ">This wicked man takes up all people with his fishhook.</text>
      <text title="catches them: ">an expression of (Prov. 6:8) “Gathers (אָגְרָה) her food in the harvest,” and (Joel 1:17) “Granaries (מַמְּגֻרוֹת) are demolished.”</text>

    <pasuk id="16">

      <text title="a fatling: ">fat.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="17">
      <text title="Because of this does he arm himself with his net: ">There are many interrogative forms that are affirmative, e.g., (I Sam. 2:27) “Did I appear?” concerning Eli, and (II Sam. 15:27) “Do you see?” Here, too: Does it appear in Your eyes that because of this he prospers every time, in that he arms himself with his net over everyone and to hunt game?</text>
      <text title="arms himself: ">As in (Gen. 14:14) “And he armed רֶק) (וַיָּ his trained men” and (Ps. 35:3): 'Arm yourself (הָרֵק) with a spear." He arms himself with his net.</text>

      <text title="On my watch I will stand: ">Habakkuk dug a circular hole, stood within it, and said, “I will not budge from here until I hear what He will say to me concerning this, my question why He looks and sees the prosperity of a wicked man.”</text>
      <text title="and what I will reply: ">to those who come to contend with me.</text>
      <text title="when I am reproved: ">mon aprobement in O.F.; the reproach one addresses to me.</text>
      <text title="when I am reproved: ">For they reprove me to my face that one should criticize the Divine standard of justice.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="And the Lord answered me and said: Write: ">for yourself the vision that will be revealed to you, and explain it well on the tablets so that one may read it swiftly. And this is the vision that you shall write.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="For there shall be another vision for the appointed time: ">A prophet shall yet arise at the end of the years, to whom a vision shall be revealed concerning when the appointed time shall be for the downfall of Babylon and the redemption of Israel.</text>
      <text title="and He shall speak of the end: ">The speech that He shall say to him concerning the end of Babylon, (Jer. 29: 10) “For at the completion of seventy years of Babylon.” וְיָפֵחַ is an expression of speech; and there are many uses of this root with similar meaning in the Book of Proverbs. Since speech is only the wind emanating from the mouth, he [the writer of the Scriptures] calls it פִּיחַ, blowing, and he calls it wind, e.g., (Ps. 33:6) “And with the wind of His mouth all their host.”</text>
      <text title="and it shall not fail; though it tarry: ">it shall not fail to come, though that appointed time may take long to come.</text>
      <text title="wait for it for…; it shall not delay: ">at all after the seventy years. This clause can also be explained to mean: though he tarry, meaning the prophet Jeremiah. Jonathan renders: the prophecy is written and explained in the Book of the Torah. He translated כְּתֹב as כָּתוּב. It has already been alluded to in the Torah (Lev. 26:34): “Then shall the land placate [God concerning] its Sabbaths.” Israel sinned by violating seventy Sabbatical Years, in which they did not release the land, and, corresponding to them, they were exiled therefrom for seventy years. And so it is stated in II Chronicles (36:21): “Until the land placated its Sabbaths; all the days it lay waste, it rested to complete seventy years.” And so you find in Ezekiel (4:5): “And I have given you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days… (verse 6) I gave you a day for a year.” And Scripture says (verse 4): “And you lie on your left side, etc.” You are found saying that Israel provoked God for three hundred and ninety years until the Ten Tribes were exiled, and the tribe of Judah sinned for forty years, and from the time the Ten Tribes were exiled until the destruction of Jerusalem are the twenty-two years of Manasseh. The rest of Manasseh’s years were spent in repentance, for it is stated concerning him (II Kings 21:2f.) “And he did what was evil, etc.,… as Ahab… had made.” Therefore we count Manasseh’s evil years according to the number of Ahab’s years, and he reigned for twenty-two years. With two years of his son Amon’s reign, and eleven of Jehoiakim’s, and eleven of Zedekiah’s, the evil years total forty-six, and this prophecy was said to Ezekiel in the fifth year of Zedekiah. In any case, we find the time of their sinning four hundred and thirty years, for after this prophecy they tarried there six years. [I.e., the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained in the land for six more years] In four hundred years, there are eight Jubilee Years, and in every Jubilee cycle there are seven Release Years, making a total of fifty-six Release Years and eight years consecrated as Jubilee Years making all together sixty-four. In thirty-six years there are five Release Years, totaling sixty-nine consecrated years, and this final Jubilee year is also counted in the number, since it was not completed because of their iniquity. And here, this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Habakkuk: A vision is already written in the Torah, but it is sealed. You write and explain on the tablets, for a vision of this appointed time will yet be revealed.</text>
      <text title="and He shall speak: ">It is an expression [denoting] speech, and there are many similar instances throughout the book of Proverbs. Since speech is merely wind that goes out of the mouth, it is called פיח or רוח, wind, as in (Psalms 33:6) “and with the breath of His mouth, all their host.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="Behold, it is puffed up: ">The soul of the wicked man is always wroth and full of desire, longing to swallow and never satisfied. עֻפְּלָה is an expression of insolence, as in (Num. 14:44) “And they acted insolently (וַיַעְפִּילוּ)” ; and (Isa. 32:14) “Rampart (עֹפֶל) and tower.”</text>
      <text title="his soul is not upright within him: ">His spirit is not satisfied within him, and he does not say, “What I have already acquired is enough.” Therefore, retribution shall come upon him.</text>
      <text title="but the righteous shall live by his faith: ">Jeconiah the king, whom this wicked man is destined to exile - his righteousness shall stand for him, and on the day this one is cast out of his grave, Evil-merodach shall raise Jehoiachin’s head and place his throne above the thrones of the kings.</text>

      <text title="And surely he, whom wine betrays: ">And surely, when Belshazzar, this one’s grandson, comes; the one whose wine shall betray him for he drank as much wine as a thousand (Dan. 5:1).</text>
      <text title="a haughty man whose dwelling shall not remain: ">[Belshazzar’s] dwelling and his residence shall not remain in existence, for he was haughty and said, with the counsel of the wine, to bring the vessels of the Temple; and he drank with them. That shall cause him to be slain, and the seed of Nebuchadnezzar to be destroyed, for a haughty man is a scorner; he shall not have a dwelling. Neither he nor his dwelling shall remain in existence.</text>
      <text title="who widened: ">Nebuchadnezzar</text>
      <text title="his desire like the nether-world: ">to attain all his desire with a full heart.</text>

      <text title="Woe to him who increases what is not his!: ">This is the figure: Woe to him who increases wealth and kingdom, and it is not his, for the kings of Media shall come and take everything.</text>
      <text title="How long?: ">will he continue to increase when he is only loading upon himself a burden of iniquity like a beam of mud? עַב is an expression of a heavy beam, as we find concerning the Tabernacle of Ezekiel (Ezek. 41: 25): “And a wooden beam (וְעָב) ,” and (ibid. 26) “The casings of the House and the beams (וְהָעֻבִּים).”</text>

      <text title="Woe to him who gives his friend to drink: ">In Seder Olam, it [this verse] is expounded regarding Belshazzar, who gave the princes to drink with the vessels of the Temple, because of which they were smitten with zaraath and intoxicated by the wrath of the Holy One, blessed be He.

Every expression of עָרְלָה is an expression of clogging, like (Jer. 6:10) “Their ear is clogged” and (Ezek 44:7) “Of clogged heart and of uncircumcised flesh.” Jonathan rendered: And become naked, an expression of (ibid. 16:7) “Naked and bare.”</text>
