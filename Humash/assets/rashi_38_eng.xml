      <text title="Adam, Seth, Enosh: ">Ezra wrote this book of genealogy through Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi during the eighteen years from the name that Zerubbabel and Joshua the Priest came to Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus I until Cyrus the son of Esther came. All of this [book] is for the [purpose of tracing the] lineage of King David and the Levites for gate sentries, guards, and singers, how David stationed them in their positions, and the priests in their watches. Therefore, he traced their lineage from Adam to Abraham, and since he had to trace Abraham’s lineage, he mentioned also the rest of the nations, his sons and his grandsons, and because of his sons, he had to trace the lineage of the rest of the nations, the sons of Canaan, to let [us] know how Abraham inherited their land. And since he had to mention and trace the lineage of the generations of Canaan, he mentioned together with them (the generations of) the rest of the nations, but he mentions them only briefly and casts them away until he reaches the main ones, as is explained in Genesis Rabbah (39:10) (See also Tanhuma Veyesheb 1). This can be compared to a king who was traveling from place to place and dropped a pearl. The king stood and sifted the sand with a sieve until he found the pearl. So said the Holy One, blessed be He, “Why should I trace the lineage of Shem and Arpachshad and Terach except to find Abraham?” [As it is written] (Neh. 9:8): “… and You found his heart faithful [before You].” And because of the honor of Isaac, he traced the lineage of the sons of Esau and Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, and he cast them away little by little and left them. He mentions the sons of Seir because the sons of Esau inherited them [i.e., their territory]; he also traces the lineage of Timna, who became a concubine to the seed of Abraham, to let us know the praise of Abraham, for she was the daughter of princes and chiefs and wished to be a concubine to the seed of Abraham, as it is written (Gen. 36:22): “… and Lotan’s sister was Timna,” and it is written (ibid. 12): “And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz the son of Esau,” because she said, “If I am not worthy to marry him, I shall be his concubine.” (Gen. Rabbah 84:14, Sanh. 99b) Moreover, for this reason, he traced the lineage of the sons of Seir because they were chiefs and princes, and Mount Seir belonged to Seir, but out of love for Isaac, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave it to Esau, as it is written (Deut. 2:12): “… and the children of Esau drove them out, etc., and settled in their place,” and to inform us of the fulfillment of the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who promised Isaac that He would multiply his seed and give him dominion over all, and because of the honor of Isaac he likewise wrote (verse. 31): “Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, etc.”</text>
      <text title="Adam, Seth, Enosh: ">This is to be interpreted like: “The sons of Adam: Seth, and the sons of Seth: Enosh,” but since they were not the main part of the genealogy, he states them briefly, and he does not mention Cain and Abel because they did not beget generations, but from Seth emerged the generations of Noah and Abraham, and from Abraham to David.</text>

    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="Noah, Shem, Ham: ">He should have counted the sons of Shem immediately to find the pearl, namely Abraham, etc., until David, but he mentions the unimportant one and treats his lineage briefly and takes hold of the main ones; and so is the method of all this genealogy of Chronicles, and so it is in the section immediately following (verses 28f.): “The sons of Abraham: Isaac and Ishmael. These are their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael was Nebaioth.” And so: (verses 34f.): “And Abraham begot Isaac; the sons of Isaac: Esau and Israel; the sons of Esau: Eliphaz,” where he mentions first the lineage of the unimportant ones and afterwards the main one.</text>

      <text title="Ashkenaz and Diphath: ">(with a “daleth”), but in the Pentateuch it is written (Gen. 10:3): “… and Riphath,” because in the beginning they were weak (רָפִים), and they did not overpower Israel, but at the end they were filled with disgrace (דֹּפִי) and evil.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="And the sons of Javan: Elisha: ">The reason he did not mention Magog and Madai is that he mentioned only the lineage of these, but he did not mention the sons of Magog or the sons of Madai or the rest because heads of nations did not emerge from them, but all their nations were called by the name of Kittim and Dodanim.</text>
      <text title="and Rodanim: ">And further (Gen. 10:4) Scripture states: “and Dodanim.” When Israel sins, they come and rule over them (רוֹדִים) , but when Israel is in power, they say, “You are the sons of our uncles (דּוֹדֵינוּ).” At first they appeared as friends when it was for their own benefit, but later they subjugated them.</text>

      <text title="And Mitzraim begot Ludim: ">In Genesis Rabbah (37:5) “Said Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: The entire coinage of Mizraim is only in the sea. Said Rabbi Joshua ben Korhah: ‘Ludim’ is written ‘Ludiim’ in chronicles, with two ‘yuds,’ to tell you that ‘Ludiim’ means לוּדֵי יָם, Ludim of the sea; Anamim, Anamim of the sea; Lehabim, Lehabim of the sea; Naphtuhim, Naphtuhim of the sea.”</text>

      <text title="And Canaan begot, etc.: ">They are eleven, and with Canaan they are twelve. This is what is written: “He set up the boundaries of the peoples.” He set up the boundaries of the peoples corresponding to the tribes of Israel, for they too are twelve; corresponding to the tribes of Israel, He set up the boundaries of the peoples, on the pattern of (Gen. 21:29): “… that you set up (הִצַּבְתָּ) by themselves.”</text>

      <text title="the earth was parted: ">The days of the people were divided and diminished, for at first people lived nine hundred years or more, and in the days of Arpachshad and thereafter, [they were diminished] to four hundred years or more, and from Peleg and thereafter, they were divided in half, to two hundred years out of those four hundred years.</text>

      <text title="all these were the sons of Joktan: ">for he belittled his affairs. Eber was a great prophet (for he named his son for a future event), but the names of the others were not meant to be expounded upon, for they were not inspired by prophetic word.</text>

      <text title="Shem, Arpachshad, Shelah: ">He enumerated the sons of Shem above, and he now commences again in Abraham’s honor. This may be compared to a king who lost a pearl, as above.</text>

    <pasuk id="27">
      <text title="Abram; he is Abraham: ">Now he traced the lineage from Shem to Abraham, and who is this Abram? He is the one who was called Abraham.</text>

      <text title="And the sons of Keturah, Abraham’s concubine: ">Anything disgraceful that he could tell about them he tells to enhance Isaac’s honor, i.e., they were all the children of a concubine, but he was the mainstay and the master of the household.</text>

      <text title="And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher, etc.: ">five heads of nations. Therefore, they appointed five kings, each one its king, as it is written (Num. 31:8): “Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, etc., the five kings of Midian.”</text>
      <text title="all these were the sons of Keturah: ">[These were mentioned] because of Abraham’s honor.</text>

      <text title="Hamran and Eshban: ">But in the Pentateuch (Gen. 36:26) it is written, “Hemdan.” At first, they were precious and desirable (חֲמוּדִין וְנֶחֱמָדִין) as righteous men, but at the end they were as ugly as a donkey. So is the way of a donkey: at first it is pretty and at the end it becomes ugly, but a horse is at first ugly and later pretty.</text>

    <pasuk id="43">
      <text title="Now these are the kings: ">It is explained (Gen. Rab. 83:2): Rabbi Aibu said: This was before a king reigned in Israel, but since a king reigned in Israel, a governor reigned in Edom. Rabbi Jose the son of Hanina says: When this one [Edom] appoints kings, this one [Israel] appoints judges; when this one appoints chiefs, this one appoints princes. Said Rabbi Joshua the son of Levi: This one [Edom] appointed eight [kings] and this one: [Israel] appointed eight [kings], and I heard [people ask]: Did Edom have only these eight kings, and did Israel have only eight? Were there not more? Joram, Ahaziah, Joash, etc. Rather, the statement that this one appointed eight kings means that when they [Edom] appointed those eight kings of Edom, they [Israel] did not appoint the kings of Israel, because they were before David.</text>

      <text title="was evil in the eyes of the Lord: ">It is explained (Gen. Rab. (85: 4) that he would “plow in the gardens,” meaning he was intimate with her in an unnatural way.</text>

    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: ">They all lived at the time of David and at the time of Solomon, and they were exceedingly wise. Concerning this it says (I Kings 5:11): “And he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol.” Further on, regarding Solomon’s wisdom, the expression is “Darda,” for even though it was called the generation of knowledge (דֵּעָה דּוּר) because of its wisdom, Solomon was wiser than all of them. Now when Scripture says הָאֶזְרָחִי, the “aleph” is superfluous, like הַזַּרְחִי (Num. 26:20), [because] he was descended from Zerah, and in many places, the “aleph” is inserted into the word, and is not pronounced, e.g. (Job. 13:17): “and my speech (וְאַחְוָתִי)” (Isa. 19:6): “And they shall abandon (וְהֶאֶזְנִיחוּ).” And likewise, (Num. 11:4): “ וְהָאסַפְסוּף, and the rabble.” Now sometimes it is completely missing, as (II Sam. 19:14): “ תֹמְרוּ, you shall say,” and likewise, (II Chron. 22:5): “… and the Arameans (הָרַמִּים) smote.” [The verse in Kings] is expounded by Pesikta (Peskikta d’Rav Kahana p. 34, Pesikta Rabbathi 14:9): “… than all men this refers to Adam. Ethan is Abraham. Heman is Moses. Calcol is Joseph. Darda is the generation of the desert. Mahol means that He forgave them for making the Calf.”</text>

      <text title="And the sons of Carmi: Achar: ">Now why do I call him Achar? Was his name not Achan? (It is explained) that [he was called thus] since he troubled Israel by transgressing the devoted thing, and because of him thirty-six thousand (sic) men fell. This is what I explained that whatever derogatory information he can tell, he tells, (but nevertheless) the kingship emanated from them.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="And the sons of Ethan: Azariah: ">Like (Gen. 46:23): “And the sons of Dan: Hushim.”</text>

    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="and Celubai: ">This is Caleb as is indicated below (v. 18): “And Caleb the son of Hezron,” and in I Sam. (25:3), it says: “… and he was a Calebite,” (כָלְבִּי) , which the Targum renders: “of the house of Caleb,” and so he explains the word: כָלְבִּי, that he (Nabal) held himself [superior] and boasted that there was no one of such high lineage as he in the entire tribe; i.e, if Samuel gave him (David) the throne, the throne will come to me. Therefore, he said, (ibid. v. 10): “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays, there are many slaves,” for he is descended from Ruth the Moabitess, and Jerahmeel his brother married a gentile woman, as is written below, and that is the meaning of “Celubai,” he was haughty and proud (with everythng); his heart exalted him.</text>

      <text title="Nahshon, the prince of the children of Judah: ">He explains this only because of David’s honor.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="11">
      <text title="and Salma begot Boaz: ">Our Sages stated (Baba Bathra 91a): “Ibzan is Boaz,” but it is amazing because how can this be? Did not Nahshon die in the second year following the Exodus from Egypt? Now Salmon, his son, had already been born, and he was one of those who entered the land, and Boaz, his son, who was Ibzan, was born when he entered the land. Now from the Exodus from Egypt until Jephthah were three hundred years, and the Sages said that when Boaz was intimate with Ruth and she conceived, Boaz died immediately, and Ibzan was a judge after the death of Jephthah, as it is written (Judg. 12:8): “And after him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.” About this I am amazed, for we find concerning Abram, that he said, “After his blood had become clotted, etc.,” and he said, (Gen. 17:17): “Shall a child be born to [a man who is] a hundred years old?” So how did Boaz beget [a child] at the age of three hundred? It is possible to say that for this reason Scripture says (Ruth 4: 13): “… and the Lord gave her conception,” on the pattern of “… and the Lord blessed him.” (Ibzan - The father of all the cold ones, for a young woman lay beside him, and he became cold and did not touch her. Not appearing in some editions.)</text>

    <pasuk id="15">
      <text title="David the seventh: ">This is written with the plene spelling, with a “yud,” because of David’s honor, and now he found the pearl; therefore, he did not count the eighth [son], Elijah.</text>

      <text title="And their sisters: Zeruiah and Abigail: ">[They are mentioned] because of David’s honor, i.e., they [Joab, Abishai, and Asael] were his sister’s sons, mighty men and princes. So it is explained further.</text>

      <text title="Jether the Ishmaelite: ">And in II Sam. (17:25) it says, “the Israelite.” He lived in the land of Ishmael, on the pattern of (ibid. 6:11): “the house of Obed Edom the Gittite,” and so, (I Ki. 7:13f.): “And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He (was) a widow’s son… and his father was a man of Tyre.”</text>

    <pasuk id="18">
      <text title="And Caleb the son of Hezron begot Azubah Ishah: ">Because he had a wife named Azubah, he named his daughter Azubah Ishah, as it is written (v. 19): “… and Azubah died, and Caleb took to himself Ephrath.” From here is deduced that he had a wife named Azubah.</text>

      <title>and she bore him Hur: </title>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="20">
      <text title="And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel: ">Figure that each of them was less than eight years old when they begot, for Caleb was forty years old during the episode of the spies, as it is written (Jos. 14:7): “I was forty years old when [Moses, the servant of the Lord] sent, etc.,” and at that time they all were already born, for the Tabernacle that Bezalel made had been erected. Caleb was eight years old when he begot Azuba Ishah, nine years old when he begot Jerioth, and after the death of Azubah, his wife, he took Ephrath, and she bore him Hur in the following year, making him ten years old, and Hur was eight years old when he begot Uri, and Uri was eight years old when he begot Bezalel, thus making 26 years, and it is written (Exod. 36:1): “and every wise hearted man,” and a man is not less than thirteen years old. So Bezalel was thirteen years old when he made the Tabernacle. Thus, we have forty years less one. We find that each one of them was less than eight years old when they begot children, and so it is explained in Chapter “ Ben sorer umoreh ” (Sanh. 69a). According to the Midrash, they begot at the age of six.</text>

    <pasuk id="21">
      <text title="And afterwards Hezron came to the daughter of Machir: ">This was because of David’s honor, because Hezron came to the daughter of Machir, taking her as a concubine, not for matrimony, similar to (Ps. 51: 2): “… when he came to Bathsheba,” and he was sixty years old, thus making two uncomplimentary qualities for Machir’s daughter: one, that he did not take her for the purpose of matrimony, and one, that he was old, but because of the esteem of the families of Judah, they gave her to him, and when Jair begot [children], Machir’s sons gave him twenty-three cities to take one of his daughters as a wife.</text>

    <pasuk id="23">
      <text title="And Geshur and Aram took: ">Geshur represents the Geshurites and the Maacathites because they were near the Arameans, who dwelt in the east of the land of Israel, and Aram dwelt in the east, as it is written (Isa. 9:11): “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west.” During the period of the Judges (Jud. 3:8), when Israel sinned, He (God) delivered them into the hands of the enemy, into the hands of Aram, and then (these) went and took them from them, and when David came, he restored them, and because he restored them, Scripture mentioned them here.</text>

      <text title="Now Jerahmeel had another wife whose name was Atarah: ">According to the simple meaning of the verse, she was an Israelitess, but in Yebamoth of the Palestinian Talmud (this is not found in our editions of Yebamoth, but in Yer. Sanh. 2:3) it is written that he took a gentile woman with whom to crown himself (עֲטָרָה). She was a beautiful princess.</text>
      <text title="she was the mother of Onam: ">(I heard) that “mother” is like (Judg. 5:7): “I arose as a mother in Israel.” And she was the mother of Onam, and Onam is an expression meaning that he was humble and weak, an expression of mourning (אוֹנֵן) , and like (Deut. 26:14): “I have not eaten of it in my mourning (בְאֹנִי) ,” and like (Num. 11:1): “… were as if in mourning over themselves (כְּמִתְאוֹנְנִים) ” Sheshan, who gave his daughter to his Egyptian slave, Jarha, was descended from him, and [the Chronicler] tells of their disgrace; that is to say, they were not deserving of the kingship, and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who assassinated Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, was descended from him (Jer. 41:1).</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="34">
      <text title="And Sheshan had no sons but daughters: ">And that which he says above (verse 31): “… and the sons of Sheshan were Ahlai,” means that he [Ahlai] was ill and humble and died without children.</text>

    <pasuk id="35">
      <text title="And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his slave for a wife: ">From here they derived that if your daughter has matured, free your slave and give him to her (Pes. 113a), and from here the Sages derived in the Palestinian Talmud, Tractate Yebamoth (source unknown): “Do not trust a proselyte until fifteen generations, and fifteen generations are from Ittai the Egyptian until Ishmael, and some say sixteen generations, including Jarha.” The midrash states the following: “Is it possible that he was of the royal descent (מִזֶּרַע הַמְלוּכָה) [as in Jeremiah 41: 1]? Now was not Ishmael of the seed of Jerahmeel and not from Ram? But rather it means that he passed his seed to the molech.”</text>

    <pasuk id="42">
      <text title="And the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel: ">Since he traced the lineage of part of the family of Caleb and interrupted in the lineage of Jerahmeel, it was necessary to say that Caleb was the brother of Jerahmeel, that this was not another Caleb. This is the manner of the entire genealogy: he does not trace lineages in sequence. He traces the lineage of part of such and such a family; he goes on to other families, and when he has completed part of this family, he goes back to tracing the lineage of the first family, and then returns to the other one, and the entire book of genealogy is mixed.</text>
      <text title="he was the father of Ziph: ">The ruler of Ziph, the ruler of all the inhabitants of Mareshah, and the ruler of Hebron, and the names of these towns are mentioned in the Book of Joshua (15:24, 44, 54), as it is written: “Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, etc.” (And it is written there:) “And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah, and Hebron (sic).”</text>

      <text title="These were the sons of Caleb, the son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephrathah: ">The interpretation is: These were the sons of Caleb. בֶּן חוּר is like בְּנו ֹחוּר, his son was Hur, and that Hur was the firstborn of Ephrath, his wife, not the firstborn of Caleb, and so it is explained above (verse 19): “And Caleb took to himself Ephrath, and she bore him Hur.” Another explanation [is that] “for these were the sons of, etc.” Hur was Caleb’s son, and he begot a son whom he named Caleb, and this is its explanation: And these were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur: Shobal, etc.</text>
      <text title="the firstborn of Ephrathah: ">but not the firstborn of Caleb. This refers to Hur. So it appears to us.</text>

Do not wonder that it is written (Judg. 13:25): “And the spirit of the Lord began to come upon him at times [in the camp of Dan] between Zorah and Eshtaol,” which means that these two towns belonged to the Danites, [which presents a difficulty] because all these stated here belonged to the Judahites. We can say [to solve this discrepancy that] the towns and the boundary that were between Zorah and Eshtaol belonged to Dan, but Zorah and Eshtaol themselves belonged to the Judahites.</text>

We can say similarly that he died and another son was born to him, and also one of these died and seven remained. For this reason, he counts there only seven, and the nine that he counts here are for David’s honor, that he had many sons, for indeed the entire Book was written because of the honor of David and his posterity.</text>

Perhaps he means Jehoiakim and Zedekiah’s sons as well] and this one’s eyes were gouged out [Zedekiah]. And he [David] prayed again on the sheminith, for the eighth generation (Ps. 6:1f.): “O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,” and because of his prayer, the sons of Jehoiakim survived, and throughout the entire Book of Psalms, there are only these two mentions of the sheminith.

For it is written (Jos. 19:9): “Out of the lot of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the portion of the children of Judah was too large for them; therefore the children of Simeon inherited in the midst of their inheritance,” lest the beasts of the field outnumber them. Now as regards the verse (ibid. v. 1): “And the second lot came out to Simeon,” this is what happened: They cast lots to choose which tribe would accept Simeon in its territory, and the lot fell upon the territory of Judah. And the meaning of the verse (Jud. 1:3): “And Judah said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and we will fight against the Canaanites, and I will also go with you into your lot,” refers to “the lot I have given you.”</text>

      <text title="he is the one who served in the Temple that Solomon built: ">Some explain that Azariah was the first Azariah, and from Azariah to Seraiah, who lived at the time of the destruction of the Temple, were eight priests. Accordingly, they emended in Yoma in the first chapter (9a), and in Leviticus Rabbah (21:9), and in Siphre , parashath Phineas (Num. 25:12), that eight high priests served in the First Temple. Some say that there were eighteen. But neither one is a viable theory because Zadok was the first who ministered in the time of Solomon. Moreover, which Amariah was in the days of Jehoshaphat, about whom it is written (II Chron 19:11): “… and behold, Amariah the head priest” ? Now he was Amariah the son of Azariah, who lived in the days of Uzziah and in the days of Hezekiah, who was after Jehoshaphat. If you say [that it was] Azariah the father of Seraiah, then where was Hilkiah the High Priest who lived in the days of Josiah? Rather we must count from Zadok, and there were twelve priests from Zadok until Seraiah, and so we find in an exact version of Leviticus Rabbah . Now that which the Scripture writes: “… he was the one who served in the Temple,” is explained in Sefer Yerushalmi (source unknown. Perhaps Sifre Zuta, Korah 18:7 is meant) as follows: Did he alone serve, and did he serve in the days of Solomon? Did not other priests serve as well? But because he risked his life for the sanctity of the Temple by not allowing Uzziah to burn incense, it is said: “he was the one who served in the Temple that Solomon built,” and he was the Azariah who lived in the days of Uzziah (ibid. 26:17, 20) and in the days of Hezekiah, and Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was Amariah the priest who served in the days of Jehoshaphat, just as Uzziah is called Azariah, as is written (II Ki. 15:1): “In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam etc, Azariah… became king.” And Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was called Zechariah, as it is written (II Chron. 26:5): “And he was wont to seek God in the days of Zechariah who understood the fear of God, etc.”</text>

Now why was Azariah the son of Seraiah the scholar not the High Priest, but [instead] his nephew Joshua the son of Jehozadak?

Ezra found scrolls: the scroll of מְעוֹנִים, the scroll of זַאַטוּטֵי and the scrolls of הָאַחִים, and they rejected the words of the one and accepted the words of the two. Likewise, they found many genealogical records. When they found three or five, they rejected the minority and accepted the majority. When they found an even number, e.g. “And in Gibeon dwelt the leader of Gibeon,” he had to write it twice because the order of their genealogy is not uniform, and likewise, [in] “the first settlers,” he found an even number, which differed one from the other. [Therefore], it was written twice: here and in his [Ezra’s] book. Now why did he not write both of them here, including those that are in Ezra: “And these are the heads of the province, etc.”? Because he traced the genealogy there until, “And these are the priests and the Levites,” and he traced the genealogy here until Jedaiah, who was after Ezra.

An example of this is that [Ephron was called by this name] because of the four hundred silver shekels, which is the numerical value of the name Ephron.

Or the meaning of צִוָּה is גָזַר decreed, like (Lam. 3:37): “… unless the Lord ordained it (צִוָּה).” The meaning is that the word that He decreed [in the Covenant] Between the Parts to give the land of Canaan to their children will be to the thousandth generation, and that which He says here: “Remember,” means: His covenant that is with you forever - remember it constantly.</text>

Therefore, it says: “hardly dwelling in it.” The meaning is that if He would say to one settler, e.g., to Abraham alone, to Isaac alone, to Jacob alone, to one of them He would say, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,” it would not be a wonder, because they were settled in it! But He swore to give you the land at a time when your ancestors were strangers sojourning in it, as it is written (Gen. 35:27): “… that is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.” And furthermore, if He would say to a stranger who is settling, “To you and to your seed I will give this land,” it would not be such a wonder.

      <text title="Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for His loving-kindness exists forever: ">This verse (34) is not a conclusion of the Psalm (96) but [a continuation] of Psalm (105): “Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His Name.” The verse (35): “And say, save us, etc.” is from the Psalm (106). And this Psalm (106) commences with this verse (in Chron.). Now is it appropriate here, “And say, etc. and save us from the nations,” for when were they exiled in David’s time, that he should say, “and save us from among the nations”? And this is the arrangement in Psalms. Psalm (105) commences: “Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name,” and it concludes only with “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, etc.” until “Amen! Hallelujah,” for it is all one topic, but because it is a long psalm, it was divided, and it commences, “Give thanks to the Lord for He is good.” Similarly, Job, when he had to lengthen his reply, he shortened it and divided it in two, and it says, (Job 29:1): “And Job again took up his parable,” for in song, because of his ecstasies of joy, he could not speak at length; so he divided it in two. And so, in the matter of lamentation, because of his intense pain he could not speak at length, and he divided it in two, because both song and lamentation are uttered similarly. When Hannah came to pray in the forecourt, Eli thought her to be a drunken woman, because he thought that she acted in that manner because of wine, but she said, (I Sam. 1:15f.): “… and neither new wine nor old wine have I drunk, etc., for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation….” From here we learn that drunken people and those suffering from pain behave in the same manner.</text>

In Psalms, it does not say, ” And say, save us “ but only, ” Save us, “ because that is the appropriate wording. For the following reason, David recited these two psalms when he brought the Ark: It is explained in Genesis Rabbah (54:4): ” since the cows, when they sang, recited these two psalms.“ Rabbi Samuel the son of Nahmani said: (I Sam. 6:12): ‘And the cows sang.’ What song did they sing? ‘Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name.’ Rabbi Eleazar says: ‘Sing to the Lord, all the earth, etc.’” Therefore, David instituted them to recite them before the Ark, one psalm in the morning and one psalm in the evening.

      <text title="And it came to pass afterwards that David smote: ">After David stated [his intention] to build a house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You shall not build,” David said, “Since it is not incumbent upon me to build the house, only upon my son, I shall now prepare and arrange everything for him for [the time] when my son comes to build the House so that he has everything prepared.” And now he [the Chronicler] leaves everything and relates how he [David] prepared the building, how he fought with his enemies and designated their spoils for the construction of the House. And so is the manner of the verse, and an example is found regarding Elijah and Elisha, i.e., after he [Elisha] said, (II Ki. 2:9): “Please let there be a double portion of your spirit to me,” he [the author] leaves the entire story of the kings and proceeds to relate some of the wonders of Elisha, how they were a double portion, until he completed them all.</text>

An example is (Sam. II 18:18): “And Absalom took and established for himself in his lifetime, etc., and he called it Yad Absalom,” meaning the power of the boundary of Absalom. Another explanation of, “and he called it Yad Absalom” : Absalom engraved the form of the length of his hand in the middle of the monument, as it is written in that verse, that he said that this engraving was engraved after the shape of Absalom’s hand.

Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, accepted him, for they [David’s brothers] were no longer mentioned, except Elihu, as it is written in the grouping of the princes (below 27: 18): “Of Judah: Elihu of the brothers of David.” That is the meaning of “for his father showed me kindness.” And it was on the basis of that hatred that David smote Moab and abused them more than his other enemies, as it is written (II Sam. 8:2): “And David smote Moab, etc.”</text>

The reason that he is called Abshai in this entire Book is because it was written in David’s honor, and it is not honor to call his nephew Abishai, meaning: “I, too, am as esteemed as David because my [grand] father was Jesse [Yishai]” Therefore, in this entire Book, he is called Abshai, and in the entire Book of Samuel he is called Abishai, except once, where he is called Abshai: (II Sam. 10: 10): “And the rest of the people he gave over to Abshai his brother.” This is according to the Masorah, because Jesse was the father of his mother, Zeruiah, who was his mother.</text>

I heard in Narbonne that it is the prevalent custom in the land of Ishmael to suspend the king’s crown over his head, and he sits opposite it below on a throne, and that which is written: “… and it was on David’s head,” means that it appeared as though it were on his head.</text>

      <text title="Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the staff of his spear was as [thick as] a weavers’ beam: ">like the round stick about which they wrap the cloth while weaving. Jonathan translated that verse in Samuel: And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of the dividing curtain of the Temple, slew. He interprets Jair (יָעִיר) as being similar to the Lebanon forest (יַעַר). He was paid in kind: Let David, whose mother wove the dividing curtain for the Temple with a weavers’ beam, slay Goliath, whose spear staff was as thick as a weavers’ beam. Now why does Scripture call him Elhanan? Because God favored him (ה׳ חֲנָנוֹ). I believe that Goliath the Gittite is not identical with Goliath the Philistine. One reason is that there [I Sam. 17:23] he called him Goliath the Philistine. Another reason is that above it is written: “… then Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the sons of Rapha,” and also below it is written: “and he too was born to Raphah.” Since he does not mention that Goliath the Gittite was a son of Rapha, it proves that he [Goliath the Gittite] was not her son</text>

And in Tractate Bechoroth (45b) it is explained why it is written: “six and six, totaling twenty-four.” It is necessary, because if it were written, “six and six,” we would say six on one hand and six on one foot. Therefore, it says, “twenty-four.” And if it would say, “twenty-four,” I would say seven on one and five on the other. Therefore, it says, “six and six, totaling twenty-four.”</text>

The truth is that because the anger of the Holy One, blessed be He, was upon David, Scripture did not write there the number of all of those whom he had counted. Neither did Joab count all the tribes, as it is written (verse 6): “… because the word of the king was repugnant to Joab.” But here, because of David’s honor, he does mention the number and the reckoning that he counted, because it is his honor that such a massive army was in his tribe. And the following is proof to what I explained: that even that small part of Israel that he counted, he did not write their entire number in Samuel, but here, [the Chronicler] did write the entire number that he counted, because it is written here: “and all Israel were,” whereas in Samuel it is not written: “all.” And it is explicitly proven here before us, as it is written: (below 27:24): “Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count but did not finish, and with this there was anger upon Israel, and the number did not reach the number of the chronicles of King David.”</text>

The fourth is in II Kings (7:9): “… we will incur guilt (עָווֹן). Now let us go and come and relate this in the king’s palace.” They said, “If we do not go and tell this in the king’s palace, it will be a grave iniquity, because enemies will come upon them.”</text>

It appears to me that he cut them into five strips to be five hundred by five hundred cubits. This was set down in the final liturgical poem for the Sabbath of Hanukkah, which commences: “Manasseh, etc.” Samuel derived all this with the holy spirit and taught it to David.</text>

      <text title="Yours, O Lord, are the greatness: ">Although I have amassed all this fortune for the building of the Temple, which is called greatness, You have given me all this greatness.</text>

      <text title="Yours is the kingdom and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything as the Leader: ">The meaning is: If a flesh and blood king gives a position or a ruling power in the kingdom to one of his servants after the prince, he is his servant wherever he is, but the kingdom does not belong to the king, and the one to whom the kingdom belongs does not have the servant, but as for the Holy One, blessed be He - the servant appointed to rule is His, and also the kingdom is His (cotre in Old French, kingdom) and therefore, it is written: “Yours is the kingdom, and You are He Who is exalted ” over them, for even the superintendent of the well is appointed from heaven (Baba Bathra 91b). They explained further: “… and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything at the beginning.” When we think that we have praised You with all the thanksgivings, and You have no more praise, it is still nothing, for the praised One stands at the beginning of the praises. And so when David concludes all his praises in Psalms, he commences with the final psalm (149:1): “Sing to the Lord a new song,” i.e., all the praises are new, as though we had never praised Him. In this manner Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Meir the son of Rabbi Isaac of Orleans explained, and it seems to me that it is so in Hagigah Yerushalmi.</text>

      <text title="and numerous sacrifices: ">It is customary for Scripture to speak in this manner; when it speaks of two or three things, it leaves the first one until the end and explains the last one immediately, and so (Gen. 31: 33): “And Laban came into Jacob’s tent… and came into Rachel’s tent.” Now was it not already stated, “And Laban came into Jacob’s tent,” which was Rachel’s tent? However, “and did not find” refers to the maidservants, mentioned last, and then he explains the first matter, “… and he went out of Leah’s tent” first, and he “came into Rachel’s tent.” From Leah’s tent he went to Rachel’s tent, but because he had to say other things about this, “And Rachel had taken, etc.” and consequently, it is inappropriate to say, “… and in the tent of the two maidservants and did not find.” Here too, he had other things to say about the sacrifices, namely…</text>

Why then did they anoint Solomon? David commanded to anoint him in order to remove [the false idea] from the heart of Adoniah’s supporters to crown him.”</text>

      <text title="And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king: ">Here it is appropriate to say that he reigned on the throne of the Lord because the throne is God’s to enthrone upon it whomever He wishes, and in the Midrash (Peskikta d’Rav Kahana p. 53a) it is explained that the throne was full (at its highest level) like the moon on the fifteenth of the month, because from Abraham to Solomon were fifteen generations: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmah, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David, and Solomon, and that is what is written: (Ps. 89:37): “… and his throne is like the sun before Me,” which never diminishes, and if you wish to compare it to the moon, it will be like the moon which will be established in the time to come. But from Solomon and onward, the kings diminished from their greatness like the moon, which continuously diminishes, until Zedekiah, (II Kings 25:7): “… and he blinded Zedekiah’ s eyes.”</text>
