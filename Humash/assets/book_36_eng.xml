<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, at the completion of the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah, the Lord aroused the Spirit of Cyrus, the king of Persia, and he issued a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">"So said Cyrus, the king of Persia, 'All the kingdoms of the earth the Lord God of the heavens delivered to me, and He commanded me to build Him a House in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Who is among you of all His people, may his God be with him, and he may

the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, with all whom God inspired to ascend to build the House of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk

cities, and the people gathered like one man to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Jeshua the son of Jehozadak arose, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, upon which to offer up burnt offerings, as it is written in the Torah of Moses, the man of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And they set the altar on its bases, for because of the fear that was upon them from the people of the lands, they offered up burnt offerings to the Lord, burnt offerings for the morning and for the evening.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they observed the feast of Succoth as is written, and the burnt offering of each day in its day, in the number, as the ordinance of each day in its day.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And afterwards [they offered] the daily burnt offering, and for the New Moon and for all the appointed seasons of the Lord that were hallowed, and for everyone who willingly offered a free-will offering to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">From the first day of the seventh month they commenced to offer up burnt offerings to the Lord, but the foundation of the Temple was not yet laid.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And they gave money to the quarriers and to the artisans, and food and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea of Jaffa, by the sanction of Cyrus the king of Persia upon them.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And in the second year of their coming to the House of God, to Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren, the priests, the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem commenced, and they stationed the Levites from twenty years old and above to conduct the work of the House of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Jeshua, his sons, and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, stood together to conduct the ones who did the work in the House of God, the children of Henadad, their sons, and their brothers, the Levites.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord, and they stationed the priests in their attire with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the Lord through David the king of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they sang aloud with praise and with thanks to the Lord for it is good, for His kindness is eternal over Israel, and the entire people shouted with a great shout with praise to the Lord because the foundation of the House of the Lord was laid.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the fathers' houses, old men who had seen the first Temple when its foundation was laid, [when they saw] this Temple with their eyes, were weeping with a loud voice, and many with a shout of joy to raise [their] voice.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the people did not recognize the voice of the shout of joy because of the voice of the people's weeping, for the people were shouting a great shout, and the voice was heard from afar.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">Now the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a Temple for the Lord God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers' houses and said to them, "Let us build with you, for like you we seek your God, and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, who brought us up here."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel said to them, "It is not for you and for us to build a House for our God, but we ourselves shall build for the Lord God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the people of the land were hindering the people of Judea and frightening them from building.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they would hire advisors against them to frustrate their plan, all the days of Cyrus, the king of Persia, and until the kingdom of Darius, the king of Persia.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the dwellers of Judea and Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And in the days of Artaxerxes, Mithredath Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote with peace, to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, and the script of the epistle was written in Aramaic and explained in Aramaic.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Rehum was the secretary, and Shimshai was the scribe; they wrote a letter about Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, as is stated.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Then Rehum the secretary and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companies, the Dinites, the Apharesattechites, the Tarpelites, the Apharesites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehites, the Elamites.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the rest of the nations whom the great and honored Asenappar exiled and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the other side of the river and Ke'eneth.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">This is the meaning of the letter that they sent to him, to Artaxerxes the king: "Your servants are the people of the other side of the river and Ke'eneth.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Let it be known to the king that the Jews who ascended from you upon us have come to Jerusalem, the rebellious and sinful city they are building, and the walls they have completed, and the walls they have joined.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now let it be known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are founded, they will not give the king's due, the head tax, or the meal tax they will not give, and the tax of the kings will suffer.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Now, in view of this, that we wish to destroy the Temple, and it is improper for us to witness the king's disgrace, we have therefore sent and notified the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">That one should search in the annals of your fathers, and you will find in the annals, and you will know that this city is a rebellious city, and it injures kings and countries, and they have made rebellion in its midst since days of yore; because of this, this city was destroyed.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">We make known to the king that if this city is built, and its walls founded, because of this, you will have no part in the other side of the river."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The king sent a word to Rehum the secretary and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companies who lived in Samaria, and the rest of the other side of the river, Shelam and Ke'eth.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">"The letter that you sent to us was explained and read before me.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the order was given by me, and they searched and found that this city had raised itself up over kings, and rebellion and disobedience were committed within it.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And mighty kings were over Jerusalem who ruled over all beyond the river, and the king's due, the head tax, and the meal tax was given to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Now issue an order to stop these men, and this city shall not be built; until orders are given by me.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And beware of committing an error in this matter. Why should the damage increase to injure the kings?"</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Then, since the interpretation of the letter of Artaxerxes the king was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companies, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and they stopped them with force and might.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Then the work of the House of God, which was in Jerusalem, was stopped, and it was suspended until the second year of the reign of Darius, the king of Persia.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judea and Jerusalem, in the Name of the God of Israel to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak arose and commenced to build the House of God, which is in Jerusalem, and with them were the prophets of God assisting them.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">At that time, there came upon them Tattenai, the governor of the other side of the river, and Shethar- Bozenai, and their companies, and so they said to them, "Who issued to you the authorization to build this House and to found these walls?"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Then, as we will say, they said to them, "What are the names of the men who are constructing this building?"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the matter came to Darius, and then they would answer the letter concerning this.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">The interpretation of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the other side of the river, and Shethar-Bozenai, and his companies, the Apharsechites, who are on the other side of the river, sent to King Darius.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">They sent a word to him, and so it was written in it: "To King Darius, all peace.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Let it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judea, to the House of the great God, and it is built of marble, and wood is laid in the walls, and this work was done quickly, and they succeeded with it.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Then we asked these elders; as follows we said to them, 'Who issued to you the authorization to build this House and to finish this wall?'</pasuk><pasuk id="10">We also asked them their names, to let you know, that we should write the names of the men who are at their head.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And as follows, they gave us a reply, saying, 'We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the House that was built many years before this, and a great king of Israel built it and founded it.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But now, since our forefathers angered the God of heaven, He delivered them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this House and exiled the people to Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">But in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued an order to build this House of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And also the vessels of the House of God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them to the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus took them from the temple of Babylon and gave them to one whose name is Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he said to him, 'Take these vessels, go, bring them down into the Temple that is in Jerusalem, and the House of God shall be built on its place.'</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then this Sheshbazzar came and began building the walls of the House of God that is in Jerusalem, and from then until now, it is built but not completed.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And now, if it pleases the king, let the royal archives that are there in Babylon be searched, whether it is so that permission was issued by King Cyrus to build this House of God in Jerusalem, and the will of the king concerning this he shall send to us."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">Then King Darius gave an order, and they searched in the library in which the archives were stored in Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And there was found in a pouch in the citadel of the province of Media one scroll, and so was written therein a memorandum:</pasuk><pasuk id="3">In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus gave an order regarding the House of God in Jerusalem, that the House should be built, a place where they offer up sacrifices, and its walls should be founded, its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Three rows of marble and a row of new wood, and the expenditures shall be given from the royal house.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And also the vessels of the House of God, of gold and silver, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the Temple that is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, let them be given over and brought to the Temple that is in Jerusalem to its place, and they shall be deposited in the House of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">"Now Tattenai, the governor of the other side of the river, Shethar-Bozenai, and their companies, the Apharsechites, who are on the other side of the river, distance yourselves from there.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Leave the work of this House of God; [to] the governors of the Jews, and [to] the elders of the Jews, [I command] this House of God they shall build in its place.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And from me shall be issued an order regarding what you shall do with these elders of the Jews to build this House of God, and from the king's property from the taxes of the other side of the river [it shall] quickly [be built.] The expenses shall be given to these men so that they should not be disrupted.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And what they require, and young bulls, and rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of the heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the statement of the priests who are in Jerusalem, let it be given to them daily without delay.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">That they should offer up pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the lives of the king and his children.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And an order is issued by me that whatever person disobeys this order, a beam shall be torn from his house, and a gallows [shall be made], upon which to place him, and his house shall be made a dungheap because of this.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And God, Who caused His name to rest there, will cast down any king or people that lays a hand to alter and destroy this House of God, which is in Jerusalem; I, Darius, have issued an edict; it shall be swiftly executed."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Then, Tattenai, the governor of the land beyond the river, Shethar-Bozenai, and their companies, in view of what King Darius had sent, as was said, acted swiftly.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the elders of the Jews were building and succeeding with the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, and they built and founded it by the command of the God of Israel and by the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the king of Persia.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the completion of this House was on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the Children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the members of the exile, performed the dedication of this House of God with joy.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they offered up for the dedication of this House of God a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and twelve he-goats for sin-offerings for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Now they set up the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their classes over the service of God, which was in Jerusalem, as is written in the Book of Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now the people of the exile made the Passover [offering] on the fourteenth of the first month.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">For the priests and the Levites purified themselves as one, so they were all pure; and they slaughtered the Passover [offering] for all the people of the exile, and for their brethren, the priests, and for themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the Children of Israel, who had returned from the exile, and whoever separated from the defilement of the nations of the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel, partook [of it].</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they celebrated the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy, for the Lord made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen their hands in the work of the House of God, the God of Israel.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">And after these incidents, in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the chief priest.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">This Ezra ascended from Babylon, and he was a fluent scholar in the Law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given, and the king granted him his entire request, according to the command of the Lord his God upon him.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And there ascended from the Children of Israel, from the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the gate-keepers, and the Nethinites to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For on the first of the first month was the commencement of the ascent from Babylon, and on the first of the fifth month, he arrived to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon him.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord and to perform and teach in Israel statute and ordinance.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And this is the interpretation of the writ that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scholar, the scholar of the words of the Lord's commandments and His statutes to Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">"Artaxerxes, king of the kings, to Ezra the priest, the scholar who has mastered the Book of the Law of the God of heaven, and Ke'eneth.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">An order is issued by me that whoever of my kingdom of the people of Israel, its priests and Levites, who volunteers to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Because of this, before the king and his seven advisors you are sent to search out Judea and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And to bring silver and gold that the king and his advisors donated to the God of Israel, Whose habitation is in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And all the silver and gold that you will find in the entire province of Babylon, with the donation of the people and the priests, which they are donating to the House of their God, which is in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Because of this, you shall quickly purchase with this money bulls, rams, lambs, and their meal-offerings, and their libations, and offer them up on the altar of the House of your God, which is in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And what pleases you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and gold, as your God wishes, you shall do.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the vessels that are given to you for the service of the House of your God, give in their entirety before the God [in] Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the rest of the necessities of the House of your God, which will fall to you to give, you shall give from the royal treasury.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And from me-I, King Artaxerxes is issued forth an edict to all the treasurers who are on the other side of the river, that whatever Ezra, the priest, the scholar of the Law of the God of heaven, requests of you shall be done quickly.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Until a hundred talents of silver, and until a hundred kors of wheat, and until a hundred baths of wine, and until a hundred baths of oil, and salt, [whose amount] is not written.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Whatever is with the authorization of the God of heaven shall be done with a seal for the House of the God of heaven, for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And we are making known to you that [as regards] all the priests, and the Levites, the musicians, the gatekeepers, the Nethinites, and those who serve in this House of God-no one should be empowered to levy the king's due, the head tax, or the meal tax upon them.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God, which is in your hand, appoint judges and magistrates who will judge all the people beyond the river, all who know the laws of your God, and whoever does not know, you shall teach them.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And whoever does not fulfill the law of your God and the law of the king promptly-judgment shall be inflicted upon him; whether to be executed, uprooted, fined, or tortured."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Blessed

before the king and his advisers, and to all the mighty officers of the king, and I strengthened myself according to the hand of the Lord my God upon me, and I gathered from Israel chiefs to go up with me.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="8"><pasuk id="1">And these are the heads of their father's houses and the lineage of those who ascended with me in the kingdom of King Artaxerxes from

for a straight way for us and for our children and for all our belongings.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">For I was ashamed to request of the king an army and horsemen to aid us from enemies on the way, for we had said to the king, "The hand of our God is upon all who seek Him for good, and His power and His wrath are upon all who forsake Him."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And we fasted and beseeched our God concerning this, and He accepted our prayer.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them, ten of their brothers.</pasuk><pasuk

id="27">And twenty sprinkling bowls of gold of one thousand darics, and two vessels of fine golden copper, precious as gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And I said to them, "You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a donation to the Lord God of your forefathers.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Hasten and guard [them] until you weigh [them] out before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers' [houses] of Israel in Jerusalem, [to deposit in] the chambers of the House of the Lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver, the gold, and the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem for the House of our God.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">Then we traveled from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our God was upon us, and He saved us from the clutches of the enemy and those who lie in wait on the way.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And we came to Jerusalem and stayed there three days.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And on the fourth day, the silver, the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the House of our God onto the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and

rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he-goats for sin-offerings, all this was a burnt offering to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And they gave the king's decrees to the satraps of the king and the governors of the land beyond the river, and they exalted the people and the House of God.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="9"><pasuk id="1">And when these were completed, the chiefs approached me, saying "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites were not separated from the peoples of the lands, like the abominations of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and the holy seed has become mingled with the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the chiefs and the deputies was first in this treachery."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And when I heard [of] this matter, I rent my garment and my robe, and I tore the hair of my head and my beard, and I sat bewildered.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And all those who hastened at the words of the God of Israel gathered to me on account of the treachery of the community of the exiles, and I sat bewildered until the evening offering.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And at the [time of] the evening offering, I arose from my fast with the rent condition of my garment and my robe, and I kneeled on my knees and spread my palms to the Lord, my God.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I said, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have increased over our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Since the days of our forefathers, we are in great guilt until this day, and because of our iniquities, we were delivered-we, our kings, our priests-into the hands of the kings of the lands by the sword, in captivity, and with plunder and with shame-facedness as of this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And now, for a short moment, favor has been granted by the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, so that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little life in our servitude.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For we are slaves, and in our servitude our God has not forsaken us, and He has extended loving-kindness upon us before the kings of Persia, to give us life, to exalt the House of our God and to erect its ruins, and to give us a fence in Judea and in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And now, what shall we say, O God, after this, for we have forsaken Your commandments,</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land that you are coming to inherit is an unclean land because of the uncleanliness of the peoples of the lands, by their abominations with which they filled it from end to end with their uncleanliness.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And now, you shall not give your daughters to their sons, neither shall you take their daughters for your sons, and you shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity to eternity, in order that you become strong and eat the goodness of the land, and you shall cause your children to inherit it to eternity.'</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And after all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and because of our great guilt, because You our God, have punished us less than our inquities deserve, and You have given us a remnant such as this.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">If we revert to breaking Your commandments to intermarrying with these abominable peoples, will You not be wroth with us until destruction without remnant or escape?</pasuk><pasuk id="15">O Lord God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left a remnant as of this day; behold we are before You in our guilt, for we cannot stand before You because of this."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="10"><pasuk id="1">And when Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and prostrating himself before the House, a very large assemblage of Israel, men, women, and children, gathered to him, for the people wept with much weeping.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Shechaniah, the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, raised his voice and said to Ezra, "We have betrayed our God, and we have taken in foreign wives of the peoples of the land, but now there is hope for Israel concerning this.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And now, let us make a covenant with our God to cast out all the wives and their offspring, by the counsel of the Lord and those who hasten to [perform] the commandment of our God, and according to the Law it shall be done.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Rise, for the matter is incumbent upon you, and we are with you; be strong and do!"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Then Ezra rose and adjured the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel to do according to this matter, and they swore.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Then Ezra rose from before the House of God, and he went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. [When] he went there, he neither ate bread nor drank water, because he was mourning over the treachery of the community of the exiles.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And they issued a proclamation in Judea and Jerusalem to all the people of the community of the exiles to assemble to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And whoever does not come by three days according to the counsel of the chiefs and the elders all his property shall be confiscated, and he shall be separated from the congregation of the exile.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And all the people of Judah and Benjamin assembled to Jerusalem by three days; that is the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month, and all the people stayed in the broad plaza of the House of God, quaking over the matter and because of the rains.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Ezra the priest arose and said to them, "You have dealt treacherously, and you have taken in foreign wives to add to Israel's guilt.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And now, confess to the Lord, the God of your forefathers, and do His will, and separate from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Then the entire congregation replied and said in a loud voice: "Yes! We must do as you say!</pasuk><pasuk id="13">But the people are many, and it is the rainy season, and there is no strength to remain outside, and the work is not for one day and not for two, for we have sinned very much in this matter.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Let our chiefs remain now with the entire congregation, and whoever is in our cities who took in foreign wives shall come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and its judges, until we avert the burning anger of our God from us until this matter [is concluded]."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, stood up against this, and Meshullam and Shabbathai the Levite supported them.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">The people of the exile did so. Ezra the priest [and certain] men, heads of the fathers' houses after the house of their fathers, separated themselves, all of them [known] by name, and they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they completed everything concerning the men who had brought in foreign women, until the first day of the first month.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And it was found of the sons of the priests who brought in foreign women, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And they advised them to cast out their wives, and the guilty ones [to bring] a ram for their guilt.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And of the sons of Harim: Maasiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nathaniel, Jozabad, and Elasah.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, and Kelajah-he is Kelita-Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And of the singers: Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And of Israel, of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, [and] Athlai.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna and Chelal; Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Simeon.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">Benjamin, Malluch, [and] Shemariah.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, [and] Shimei.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhu.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">Vaniah, Meremoth, Elyashib.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasai.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">Bani, Binnui, Shimei.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Banaiah.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">All these had taken foreign wives, and some of them had wives by whom they had children.</pasuk></chapter></book>
