<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself upon his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and He made him exceedingly great.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Solomon said to all Israel, to the leaders of the thousands and the hundreds and to the judges and to every prince of all Israel, the chiefs of the fathers' [houses].</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Solomon and the entire assembly with him went to the high place that was in Gibeon, for there was God's Tent of Meeting, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had made in the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">But David had brought up the Ark of God from Kiriath-Jearim in [the place that] David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the copper altar that Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made he placed before the Tabernacle of the Lord, and Solomon and the assembly sought it.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Solomon offered up there on the copper altar before the Lord, which belonged to the Tent of Meeting, and he offered up on it a thousand burnt offerings.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">On that night, God appeared to Solomon, and He said to him, "Request, what shall I give you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">.And Solomon said to God, "You performed great loving-kindness with my father David, and You enthroned me in his stead.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Now, O Lord God, may Your word with my father David come true, for You have enthroned me over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now, give me wisdom and knowledge, and I shall go forth before this people and come in, for who will be able to judge this great people of Yours?"</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And God said to Solomon, "Since this was in your heart, and you did not request riches, possessions, and honor, neither have you requested the life of your enemies, nor have you requested many days, but you have requested for yourself wisdom and knowledge, that you should judge My people, over whom I have enthroned you.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Wisdom and knowledge are granted you, and riches, possessions, and honor I shall grant you, such as that the kings before you did not possess, and which will not be so after you."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Solomon, [who] had come to the high place, which was in Gibeon, [came] to Jerusalem, from before the Tent of Meeting, and he reigned over Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he left them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem like stones, and the cedars he made as numerous as the sycamores that are in the lowland.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Solomon's source of horses was from Egypt, and [there was] an assemblage, from which the king's agents would buy the assemblage privileges for a price.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they brought up and took out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty, and so to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram they would export through them.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Solomon ordered to build a House in the name of the Lord and a house for his kingdom.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">And Solomon counted seventy thousand who bore burdens and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred were overseeing them.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, "As you did with my father David, and you sent him cedars to build for himself a House in which to dwell.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Behold I am building a house in the name of the Lord my God, to devote to Him, to burn before Him incense and the arrangement of the continual showbread and burnt offerings, for the morning and for the evening, for Sabbaths and for New Moons, and for the appointed seasons of the Lord our God, making this permanent over Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the House which I am building is great, for our God is greater than all gods.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And who can gather up strength to build Him a House, for the heavens and the heavens of the heavens cannot contain Him, and who am I that I should build Him a House, only to burn incense before Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And now, send me a wise man to work with gold, with silver, with copper, with iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn, and who knows how to make engravings with the wise men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom my father David prepared.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And send me cedar wood, cypress wood, and brazilwood from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut the trees of Lebanon, and behold my servants are with your servants.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And to prepare for me abundant timber, for the House that I am building is large and wonderful.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And behold for the wood cutters, for those who cut the timber, I shall give abundant wheat for your servants, twenty thousand kors, and barley twenty thousand kors, and wine twenty thousand baths, and oil twenty thousand baths."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Huram the king of Tyre said in writing, and sent to Solomon, "Because of the Lord's love for His people, He made you king over them."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Huram the king of Tyre said, "Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, Who made the heavens and the earth, Who gave King David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and understanding, who will build a House for the Lord and a house for his kingdom.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And now, I have sent a wise man, endowed with understanding, of my father Huram.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a Tyrian man, who knew how to work with gold, with silver, with copper, with iron, with stones, with wood, with purple, with blue, and with fine linen and with crimson yarn, and to engrave all types of engravings, and to devise ideas, [to do] what is given to him with your wise men and the wise men of my lord, your father David.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And now, the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord said, he shall send to his servants.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And we shall cut timber from Lebanon, as much as you need, and we shall bring it to you as rafts on the sea of Joppa, and you will bring them up to Jerusalem."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Solomon counted all the strangers who were in the land of Israel, after the census in which his father David had counted them, and they were found to be one hundred fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he made of them seventy thousand who bear burdens, eighty thousand who hew in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers, to make the people work.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">And Solomon commenced to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where He had appeared to his father David, which he had prepared in David's place, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he commenced to build in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And [with] these Solomon was counseled to build the House of God; the length in cubits, in the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth was twenty cubits.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the vestibule, the length of which was according to the breadth of the House, was twenty cubits, and the height was one hundred and twenty, and he overlaid it from within with pure gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the greater House he overlaid with juniper wood, and he overlaid it with fine gold, and he wrought upon it palm trees and chains.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he overlaid the House with precious stone for glory, and the gold was the gold of Parvaim.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he overlaid the House; the beams, the sideposts and its walls and its doors with gold, and he engraved cherubim on the walls.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he made the House of the Holy of Holies, its length on the face of the breadth of the House, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold of six hundred talents.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the weight of the nails in shekels, fifty of gold, and the upper stories he overlaid with gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And he made in the Holy of Holies two cherubim, with the appearance of children, and they overlaid them with gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the wings of the cherubim-their length was twenty cubits, the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching the wall of the House, and the other wing was five cubits, reaching the wing of the other cherub.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching the wall of the House, and the other wing was five cubits, cleaving to the wing of the other cherub.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">The wings of these cherubim were spread out twenty cubits, and they were standing on their feet with their faces to the House.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he made the dividing curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarn, and fine linen, and he wrought cherubim into it.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he made before the House two pillars, thirty-five cubits long, and the capital that was on the top of each one was five cubits.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he made chains in the Debir, and he placed [them] atop the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and placed them in the chains.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he erected the pillars before the Heichal, one from the right and one from the left, and he named the right one Jachin and the left one Boaz.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And he made the copper altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he made the molten sea, ten cubits from brim to brim; it was round all about, and the height thereof was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits did encompass it round about.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the likeness of oxen was beneath it, round about, encompassing it; ten cubits encompassing the sea round about; the oxen were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">It stood on twelve oxen, three facing northward, three facing westward, three facing southward, and three facing eastward, and the sea was above them, and all their hind parts were inward.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; it contained baths; it contained three thousand.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he made ten lavers, and he placed five on the right and five on the left, to wash with them; the performance of the burnt offering they would rinse with them, and the sea was for the priests to wash therein.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he made the ten golden candelabra according to their regulations, and he placed five in the Heichal, five from the right and five from the left.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he made ten tables and placed them in the Heichal, five from the right and five from the left, and he made a hundred golden basins.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And he made the priests' court and the large court, and doors for the forecourt, and he overlaid their doors with copper.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And he placed the sea from the right side eastward opposite the south.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins, and Huram finished doing the work that he did for King Solomon in the House of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Two pillars and the two bowls and chapiters atop the pillars, and the networks were two to cover the two bowls of the chapiters, which were atop the pillars.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates to one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters, which were before the pillars.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he made the bases, and he made the lavers on the bases.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">The one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the pots, and the shovels, and the forks and all their vessels, his father Huram made for King Solomon for the House of the Lord, of burnished copper.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">In the plain of the Jordan did Solomon cast them in the thickness of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Solomon made all these vessels of great abundance, for the weight of the copper was not found out.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Solomon made all these vessels, which were in the House of God; the golden altar, the tables, and the showbread upon them.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the candelabra and their lamps to kindle them as is required, before the Debir, of refined gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the flower and the lamps and the tongs were gold, it was fine gold.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the musical instruments, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of refined gold, and the entrance to the House, its inner doors to the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the House to the Heichal were gold.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">Now all the work that Solomon did for the House of the Lord was completed, and Solomon brought his father David's hallowed things, and the silver and the gold and all the vessels he deposited in the treasuries of the House of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the chiefs of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the Children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And all the men of Israel assembled on the festival; that is the seventh month.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites bore the Ark.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they brought up the Ark and the Tent of Meeting, and all the sacred vessels that were in the Tent; the priests [and] the Levites brought them up.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were gathered with him before the Ark were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered because of their abundance.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place, to the Debir of the House, to the Holy of Holies, to [the place] beneath the wings of the cherubim.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the Ark, and the cherubim covered over the Ark and over its staves from above.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And they extended the staves so that the ends of the staves were seen from the Ark before the Debir, but they were not seen outside, and they were there until this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">There was nothing in the Ark but the two tablets that Moses gave in Horeb, when the Lord made [a covenant] with the Children of Israel when they left Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it came to pass when the priests left the Holy, for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves; not taking heed of the divisions.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the Levites who sang-all of them, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, attired in fine linen, with cymbals and with psalteries and with harps, standing east of the altar, and with them were priests-one hundred twenty sounding with trumpets.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the trumpeters and the singers were as one, to make one sound, to praise and to thank the Lord, and when they raised a sound with trumpets and with cymbals and with the musical instruments and with praise to the Lord, "for He is good, because His kindness is eternal," and the House became full of the cloud of the House of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the priests could not stand to serve because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the House of God.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">Then Solomon said, "The Lord said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">But I have built You a House to dwell in; a settled place for You to dwell in forever."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel stood.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, Who spoke with His mouth to David my father, and has fulfilled it with His hand, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Since the day that I brought My people forth from the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a House, that My name might be therein, neither did I choose a man to be prince over My people Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I chose Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I chose David to be over My people Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it was in my father David's heart [the desire] to build a House for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the Lord said to David my father; Since it was in your heart to build a House to My name, you did well that it was in your heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Nevertheless, you shall not build the House, but your son who will come forth out of your loins he shall build the House for My name.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the Lord has established His word that He spoke, and I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I have sat on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the House for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And I have set there the Ark, wherein is the Covenant of the Lord, which He made with the Children of Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And he stood before the altar of the Lord opposite all the congregation of Israel, and he spread forth his hands.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">For Solomon had made a copper laver, which he had placed within the forecourt, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and he stood on it and kneeled on his knees opposite all the congregation of Israel, and he spread forth his hands toward heaven.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he said, "Lord God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth, Who keeps the covenant and the kindness with Your servants, who walk before You with all their heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">For You have kept for Your servant David my father that which You spoke to him, and You spoke with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as [it is] this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And now, O Lord God of Israel, keep for Your servant, David my father, that which You spoke to him, saying, 'You shall never lack a man before Me sitting on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in My Law as you have walked before Me.'</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And now, O Lord God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You spoke to Your servant, to David.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You; much less this House that I have built.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And You shall turn to Your servant's prayer and to his supplication, O Lord my God; to hearken to the cry and to the prayer that Your servant is praying before You.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">That Your eyes may be open toward this House day and night, toward the place in which You said that You would put Your name, to hearken to the prayer that Your servant will pray in this place.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And You shall hearken to the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they will pray toward this place; You shall hear from Your abode, from heaven, and You shall hear and forgive.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Your altar in this House.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">You shall hear from heaven, and do, and judge Your servants, to recompense the wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and to justify the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And if Your people Israel is struck down before the enemy because they sin against You, and they repent and confess to Your name and pray and make supplication before You in this House.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">You shall hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land that You gave to them and to their fathers.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess to Your name, and repent of their sin, so that You may answer them.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">You shall hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, for You will teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and You shall give rain upon Your land, which You have given Your people for an inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blast, mildew, increasing locusts, finishing locusts, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness [there be].</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Any prayer, any supplication, which will be [made] by any man or by all Your people Israel, every man shall know his plague and his pain, and spread forth his hands toward this House.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">You shall hear from heaven, Your dwelling, and forgive, and give to each man according to his ways, whose heart You know, for You alone know the hearts of the children of men.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">That they may fear You to go in Your ways all the days that they live on the face of the land that You gave our fathers.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And also to the stranger, who is not of Your people Israel, but will come from a distant land because of Your great name, Your strong hand, and Your outstretched arm, and they will come and pray toward this House.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">You shall hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, and You shall do whatever the stranger calls upon You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name, to fear You, as [do] Your people Israel, and that they may know that Your name is called upon this House, which I have built.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">If Your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way You send them, and pray to You toward this city, which You have chosen, and the House that I have built for Your name.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">You shall hear from heaven their prayer and supplication and maintain their cause.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">If they sin against You, for there is no man who does not sin, and You will be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and their captors will carry them in captivity to a land, far or near.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And they bethink themselves in the land where they were carried off into captivity, and repent and make supplications to You in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned; we have dealt perversely, and we have committed wickedness.'</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity where they led them away captives, and pray toward their land, which You gave to their fathers, and the city that You chose, and toward the House that I built for Your name.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">You shall hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and You shall forgive Your people who sinned against You.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">Now, my God, may Your eyes now be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And now, arise, O Lord God to Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your might; Your priests, O Lord God, shall be attired with salvation, and Your pious ones shall rejoice with the goodness.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">O Lord God, do not turn back the face of Your anointed one; remember the kind deeds of David Your servant."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">And when Solomon finished praying, and the fire descended from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the House.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the priests could not enter the House of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord filled the House of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And all the Children of Israel saw the descent of the fire, and the glory of the Lord on the House, and they kneeled on their faces to the ground on the floor, and they prostrated themselves and [said]: "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His loving-kindness is eternal."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the king and all the people were slaughtering sacrifices before the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And King Solomon slaughtered the sacrifices of cattle, twenty-two thousand, and sheep, one hundred and twenty thousand, and they dedicated the House of God, the king and all the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the priests were standing on their watches, and the Levites with the instruments of the song of the Lord, which King David had made to give thanks to the Lord, for His loving-kindness is eternal, with David's praise in their hand; and the priests were sounding the trumpets opposite them, and all Israel were standing.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Solomon consecrated the interior of the court that was before the House of the Lord, for there he offered up the burnt offerings and the fats of the peace offerings, for the copper altar that Solomon had made could not contain the burnt offerings, the meal offerings, and the fats.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Now Solomon observed the Feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assemblage from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And they made on the eighth day a solemn gathering, for the inauguration of the altar they made seven days, and the feast seven days.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And on the twenty- third day of the seventh month, he dismissed the people to their homes, rejoicing and delighted of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had wrought for David, for Solomon, and for Israel His people.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Solomon completed the House of the Lord and the king's palace and whatever entered Solomon's mind to make in the House of the Lord and in his palace, he succeeded.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the Lord appeared to Solomon at night, and He said to him, "I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for Myself for a House of sacrifice.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">If I shut up the heaven and there be no rain, and if I command locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence upon My people.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And My people, upon whom My name is called, humble themselves and pray and seek My presence and repent of their evil ways, I shall hear from heaven and forgive their sin and heal their land.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now, My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer of this place.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And now, I have chosen and consecrated this House that My name be there forever, and My eyes and heart will be there at all times.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I commanded you, and you keep My statutes and My ordinances.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">I shall set up the throne of your kingdom as I decreed to your father David, saying: You shall never lack a man ruling in Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">But if you revert and forsake My statutes and My commandments, which I placed before you, and you go and worship strange gods and prostrate yourselves to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">I shall uproot them from upon My land, which I gave them, and this House, which I have consecrated for My name I shall cast from before Me, and I shall make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And this House, which was exalted, every passerby will be astounded, and they will say: Why has the Lord done this to this country and to this Temple?</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they will be told: Because they forsook the Lord, the God of their forefathers, Who took them out of the land of Egypt, and they adopted strange gods and prostrated themselves to them and worshiped them;

so their brethren, the Levites, reinforced them until the work was completed and until the priests consecrated themselves, for the Levites were more conscientious than the priests to consecrate themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And also, there were many burnt-offerings with the fats of the peace- offerings and with the libations for the burnt-offerings, and the service of the House of the Lord was established.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over that which God had prepared for the people, because the matter was sudden.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="30"><pasuk id="1">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the House of the Lord in Jerusalem, to perform the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, the God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the king and his officers and the entire congregation took counsel in Jerusalem, to perform the Passover sacrifice in the second month.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">For they could not perform it at that time, for the priests had not consecrated themselves sufficiently, and the people had not gathered to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the matter was proper in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of the entire congregation.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they issued a statement to announce throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan to come to perform a Passover sacrifice to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Jerusalem, because for many years they had not performed it as it is written.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">So the couriers went with the letters from the hand of the king and his officers throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the king's command, saying, "Children of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that He may return to the remnant that has escaped from the clutches of the kings of Assyria.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And do not be like your fathers or like your brothers, who acted treacherously against the Lord, the God of their fathers, and He made them a desolation, as you see.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Now, do not be stiffnecked like your fathers; give a hand to the Lord and come to His Sanctuary which He consecrated forever, and worship the Lord your God, so that His burning wrath returns from you.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For when you return to the Lord, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before their captors and shall return to this land, for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now the couriers passed from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, and they laughed at them and mocked them.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">But people from Asher and Manasseh and from Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one accord, to perform the command of the king and the officers concerning the word of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And a huge crowd assembled in Jerusalem to observe the Festival of Matzoth in the second month, an exceedingly large assembly.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And they arose and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they removed and cast them into the Kidron Valley.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the second month, and the priests and the Levites were embarrassed, and they consecrated themselves and brought burnt-offerings to the House of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And they stood in their station as was their custom, according to the Torah of Moses, the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood from the hand of the Levites.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For there were many among the congregation who had not consecrated themselves, and the Levites were in charge of the slaughter of the Passover sacrifices for everyone who was unclean, to make it holy for the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, for they ate the Passover sacrifice not as it is written, for Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, "May the good Lord atone for</pasuk><pasuk id="19">anyone who has set his whole heart to seek God, the Lord, the God of his forefathers, though [he be] not [cleaned] according to the purity that pertains the holy things."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the Children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem observed the Festival of Matzoth for seven days with great joy, the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, with powerful instruments to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Hezekiah prevailed upon all the Levites who were experts in the service of the Lord, and they ate [the sacrifices of] the appointed season for seven days, sacrificing peace-offerings and thanking the Lord, the God of their forefathers.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the entire congregation took counsel to keep another seven days; and they kept seven days of joy.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">For Hezekiah, the king of Judah, separated for the congregation one thousand bulls and seven thousand small cattle, and the officers separated for the congregation one thousand bulls and ten thousand small cattle, and the priests consecrated themselves in great numbers.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And the entire congregation of Judah and the priests and the Levites and the entire congregation that came from Israel, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and those who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel [there had] not [been] the like in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to His holy habitation, to heaven.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="31"><pasuk id="1">And when they completed all this, all the Israelites who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and they smashed the monuments and cut down the asherim, and they demolished the high places and the altars from all Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh until they had completely destroyed [them], and all the Children of Israel returned, each man to his inheritance, to their cities.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Hezekiah stationed the divisions of the priests and the Levites in their divisions each man according to his service, for the priests and for the Levites; for burnt-offerings and for peace- offerings, to minister and to thank and praise in the gates of the camps of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the king's portion from his possessions for the burnt- offerings, for the burnt-offerings of the morning and the evening and the burnt-offerings for the Sabbaths and for the New Moons and for the appointed seasons, as is written in the Law of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he commanded the inhabitants of Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, in order that they be strengthened in the Law of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And when the word burst forth, the Children of Israel increased the first of corn, wine, oil, honey, and all the increase of the field, and the tithes of everything they brought in abundance.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the Children of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah-they too brought tithes of large cattle and small cattle and the tithes of sacred things consecrated to the Lord their God, and they gave many stacks.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">In the third month, they commenced to lay the foundations of the stacks, and in the seventh month they finished.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Hezekiah and his officers came, and they saw the stacks, and they blessed the Lord and His people Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Hezekiah demanded of the priests and the Levites concerning the stacks.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Azariah, the chief priest of the house of Zadok, said to him, and he said, "From the beginning of bringing the heave-offering to the House of the Lord, we ate to satiety and left over in abundance, for the Lord had blessed His people, and what is left over is this abundance."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Hezekiah ordered to prepare the chambers in the House of the Lord, and they prepared [them].</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they brought the heave-offerings and the tithes and the sacred things faithfully, and over them was the ruler, Conaniah the Levite, and Shimei his brother, the second in command.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah, appointees under the jurisdiction of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the command of King Hezekiah and Azariah the ruler of the House of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gate sentry of the East Gate was over the donations of God, to give the heave-offering of the Lord and the most holy of the sacred things.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And next to him were Eden and Minjamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah, Amariah and Shechaniah in the cities of the priests in offices of trust, to give their brethren in the divisions, to the great as to the small.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Besides those who traced their genealogy, of the males from three years old and upwards, for everyone who comes to the House of the Lord, for his daily necessities, for their service in their watches, according to their divisions.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the priests who traced their genealogy to the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upwards, in their watches, in their divisions.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And for all those whose genealogy was traced, concerning all their infants, their wives, and their sons and daughters, of every congregation, for with their faith they consecrated the holy things.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And for the sons of Aaron the priests, in the fields of the open land of their cities, in every city, were men who were mentioned by names, to give portions to every male among the priests and to all who traced their lineage among the Levites.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Hezekiah did accordingly in all the cities of Judah, and he did what was good and proper and true before the Lord his God.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And in every deed that he commenced in the service of the House of God and in the Law and in the commandment, to seek God;

do not fear and do not be dismayed because of the king of Assyria and because of all the multitude that is with him, because He Who is with us is greater than those with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">With him is an arm of flesh, and with us is the Lord our God to help us and to wage our wars," and the people relied on the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">After this, Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem- and he was besieging Lachish, and all his staff was with him-to Hezekiah the king of Judah, and to all the Judeans who were in Jerusalem, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="10">"So said Sennacherib the king of Assyria: In what do you trust that you stay in the siege in Jerusalem?</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Is not Hezekiah enticing you to give you over to die by famine and thirst, saying: The Lord, our God, will save us from the clutches of the king of Assyria?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Did not he - Hezekiah - remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying: Before one altar you shall prostrate yourselves, and upon it you shall burn incense?</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Do you not know what I did-I and my forefathers-to all the peoples of the lands? Could the gods of the nations of the lands save their land from my hand?</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Who is it among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers destroyed, that could save his people from my hand, that your God should be able to save you from my hand?</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And now, let Hezekiah not deceive you, and let him not entice you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom could save his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers; surely your God will not save you from my hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And his servants spoke further against the Lord God and against Hezekiah His servant.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he wrote letters to blaspheme the Lord, the God of Israel, and to say about Him, saying, "Like the gods of the nations of the lands, which did not save their people from my hand, so will the God of Hezekiah not save His people from my hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And they called out with a loud voice in Judean to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and to terrify them, so that they might seize the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the land, the handiwork of man.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And King Hezekiah and the prophet, Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed concerning this, and they cried out to Heaven.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the

altars to the baalim, and he made asheroth, and he prostrated himself to the entire host of the heaven, and he worshipped them.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he built altars in the House of the Lord, concerning which the Lord had said, "In Jerusalem, My name shall be forever."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he built altars to the entire host of heaven in the two courts of the House of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he passed his sons through fire in the valley of Ben Hinnom; he practiced soothsaying, divination, and sorcery, and he consulted necromancers and those who divine by the jidoa bone; he did much that was evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he placed the graven image of the idol that he made, in the House of God, concerning which God

destroyed from before the Children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they did not listen.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the Lord brought upon them the generals of the king of Assyria, and they seized Manasseh with hooks and bound him with copper chains and brought him to Babylon.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And when he was distressed, he entreated the Lord his God, and he humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he prayed to Him, and He accepted his prayer, and He heard his supplication and He restored him to Jerusalem to his kingdom, and Manasseh knew that the Lord was God.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And afterwards, he built an outer wall to the City of David on the west of Gihon in the valley, even to the Fish Gate, and he surrounded the Ophel and raised it exceedingly, and he placed military officers in all the fortified cities in Judah.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he removed the foreign gods and the idol from the House of the Lord and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the House of the Lord and in Jerusalem, and he cast them outside the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he built the altar of the Lord, and he sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thanksgiving offerings, and he told Judah to worship the Lord God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">But the people were still sacrificing on the high places, but only to the Lord their God.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the rest of Manasseh's affairs and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel-behold they are with the affairs of the kings of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And his prayer and its acceptance, and his sin and his treacherous acts, and the
