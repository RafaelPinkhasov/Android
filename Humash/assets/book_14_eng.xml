<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth [month] on the fifth day of the month, as I was in the midst of the exile by the river Chebar-the heavens opened up, and I saw visions of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">"On the fifth of the month"-that is the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">The word of the Lord was [revealed] to Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar, and the hand of the Lord came upon him there.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And I saw, and behold, a tempest was coming from the north, a huge cloud and a flaming fire with a brightness around it; and from its midst, it was like the color of the chashmal from the midst of the fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And from its midst was the likeness of four living beings, and this is their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And [each] one had four faces, and [each] one had four wings.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And their legs were straight legs, and the soles of their feet were like a round foot, and they sparkled like the color of burnished copper.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And human hands were beneath their wings on their four sides, and their faces and their wings were [the same] to all four of them.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Their wings joined one to the other; they did not turn when they walked; each one would go toward the direction of his face.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion was on their right, to the four of them, and the face of an ox to their left, to the four of them, and the face of an eagle [was] to the four of them.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And so were their faces. And their wings were extended upward; each one had two wings joined to each other, and two covering their bodies.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Now each one would go toward the direction of his face; wherever would be the will to go, they would go; they did not turn as they walked.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the likeness of the living beings; their appearance was like fiery coals, burning like the appearance of firebrands; it was going among the living beings; and there was a brightness to the fire and from the fire came forth lightning.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the living beings would run and return, like the appearance of the sparks.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And I saw the living beings, and behold, one wheel [was] on the ground beside the living beings for its four faces.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the appearance of crystal, and the four of them had one likeness, and their appearance and their workings were as a wheel would be within a wheel.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">When they went, they went toward their four sides; they did not turn when they went.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And they had backs, and they were very high, and they were dreadful, and their eyebrows were full of eyes round about-[so it was] to the four of them.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And when the living beings would go, the wheels would go beside them; and when the living beings would lift themselves off the ground, the wheels would lift themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Wherever there was the will to go, they would go; there was the will to go, and the wheels would lift themselves correspondingly to them, for the will of the living being was in the wheels.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">When they [the living beings] would go, they [the wheels] would go, and when they would stand, they would stand, and when they would lift themselves up from the ground, the wheels would lift themselves correspondingly to them, for the will of the living being was in the wheels.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And there was a likeness over the heads of the living beings, of an expanse like the color of the severe frost extended over their heads above.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And beneath the expanse, their wings were straight, one [pointed] toward the other; this one had two that covered, to here, and that one had two that covered, to here, their bodies.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters like the voice of the Almighty-when they went; the sound of stirring, like the sound of a camp; when they would stand, they would let down their wings.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads; when they stood still, they would let down their wings.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And above the expanse that was over their heads, like the appearance of a sapphire stone, was the likeness of a throne, and on the likeness of the throne, was a likeness like the appearance of a man upon it above.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And I saw like the color of chashmal like the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and above; and from the appearance of his loins and below, I saw [a thing] like the appearance of fire, and there was a brightness round about it.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Like the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness round about; that was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord, and when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">And He said to me; "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I shall speak with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Now the spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and it stood me on my feet, and I heard what was being spoken to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And He said to me; "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, which rebelled against Me; they and their fathers rebelled against Me to this very day.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the sons, who are brazen-faced and hard-hearted-I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'So said the Lord God.'</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they, whether they listen or whether they forbear-for they are a rebellious house-they shall know that a prophet was in their midst.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And you, son of man, fear them not, and fear not their words, for they are obstinate and thorny with you, and you sit on eglantines; fear not their words, neither be dismayed by them, for they are a rebellious house.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And you shall speak My words to them; whether they listen or they forbear, for they are rebellious.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">But you, son of man, hearken to what I speak to you; do not be rebellious like the rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I saw, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and behold, in it was a scroll of a book.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And it spread it out before me, and it was inscribed before and behind, and there was written upon it lamentations and murmuring and woe.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">And He said to me; "Son of man, that which you find, eat; eat this scroll and go, speak to the house of Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And He said to me, "Feed your stomach and fill your bowels with this scroll, which I give you"; so I ate, and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And He said to me; "Son of man, go, come to the house of Israel and speak to them with My words.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">For it is not to a people of an unfathomable language and a heavy tongue that you are sent, [but] to the house of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Not to many peoples, of deep language and heavy tongue, whose words you do not understand-had I sent you to them, I swear they would hearken to you!</pasuk><pasuk id="7">But the house of Israel will not be willing to hearken to you, because they are not willing to hearken to Me; for all the house of Israel are brazen and of stubborn heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Behold I have set your face hard against their face and your forehead hard against their forehead.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">As shamir, stronger than flint, I have set your forehead; fear them not, neither shall you be intimidated by them, for they are a rebellious house."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And He said to me; "Son of man, all My words which I shall speak to you, take into your heart, and hearken with your ears.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And go, come to the exile, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and say to them, 'So said the Lord God,' whether they will listen or whether they will forbear."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great uproar: "Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Then the sound of the wings of the living beings were [heard] touching one another, and the sound of the wheels opposite them, and the sound of a great uproar.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And a wind lifted me and took me, and I went, embittered in the wrath of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord became strong upon me.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And I came to the exiled, to Tel Aviv, who dwelt by the river Chebar, and I dwelt where they were dwelling, and I sat there seven days bewildered among them.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="17">"Son of man, I have made you a lookout for the house of Israel, and you shall hear a word from My mouth, and you shall give them warning from Me.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">If I say to the wicked man, 'You will die,' and you do not exhort him, nor speak to exhort a wicked man [to repent] of his wicked way, to save his life, he is guilty; he will die because of his iniquity, and I shall require his blood from your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">But you-if you do warn the wicked man, and he does not repent of his wickedness and of his evil way, he will die because of his iniquity, and you-you will have saved your soul.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And when a righteous man repents of his righteousness and commits injustice, I shall place a stumbling block before him-he will die; if you do not warn him, he will die because of his sin, and his righteous deeds that he performed will not be remembered, but I shall require his blood from your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">But you, if you warn him-the righteous man-that a righteous man should not sin, and he does not sin-he will live because he took heed, and you-you will have saved your soul."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">The hand of the Lord came upon me there, and He said to me, "Arise, go out to the plain, and there I shall speak with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">So I arose and went out to the plain and behold, there the glory of the Lord was standing, like the glory that I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And a spirit entered into me and stood me up on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, "Come, confine yourself within your house.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And you, son of man, behold they have placed ropes upon you and have bound you with them, and you shall not go out among them.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And I shall cause your tongue to cling to your palate, and you shall become dumb, and you shall not be a reprover to them, for a house of rebellion are they.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And when I speak with you, I shall open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'So said the Lord God.' He who listens will listen, and he who forbears will forbear, for a house of rebellion are they.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">"Now you, son of man, take a brick for yourself and place it before you, and engrave upon it a city-Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And you shall lay siege upon it and build around it a stone-throwing catapult, and you shall pour over it a siege mound, and you shall place camps upon it and place villages around it.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And you shall take yourself an iron skillet and make it an iron wall between you and the city and direct your face toward it, and it will be in the siege and you shall besiege it; that is a sign to the house of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And you shall lie on your left side, and you shall place the iniquity of the house of Israel through it; the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you will bear their iniquity.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Now I have given you the years of their iniquity by the number of days, three hundred and ninety days, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And when you complete these, you shall lie on your right side a second time, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; forty days, a day for a year, a day for a year, I have given it to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And to the siege of Jerusalem you shall direct your face, and your arm shall be bared, and you shall prophesy about it.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And behold, I have placed ropes upon you, and you shall not turn from side to side until you complete the days of your siege.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And you, take yourself wheat and barley, and beans and lentils, and millet and spelt. You shall place them in one vessel, and prepare them for yourself for food; the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days you shall eat it.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And your food that you will eat shall be with a weight, twenty shekels for a day; from time to time you shall eat it.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And water by measure you shall drink, a sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink [it].</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And as barley cakes you shall eat it, and they shall bake it with human excrement before their eyes."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the Lord said, "So will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I shall drive them."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And I said, "O Lord God, behold my soul has not been defiled, neither have I eaten from an animal that died by itself and was torn [by beasts], from my youth until this day, and no loathsome meat has ever entered my mouth."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">So He said to me, "See! I have given you cattle dung instead of human excrement, and you shall prepare your bread upon it."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And He said to me, "Son of man, behold I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread with a weight and with worry, and water with a measure and with bewilderment they will drink.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Because they will lack bread and water, and they will be appalled, one man and his brother, and they will pine away in their iniquity.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">"Now you, son of man, take yourself a sharp sword, a cobbler's razor you shall take to yourself, and you shall pass it over your head and over your beard, and you shall take yourself a scale and divide them.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">A third with fire shall you burn it in the midst of the city as the completion of the days of the siege; and you shall take a third and strike [it] with a sword all around it, and a third you shall scatter to the wind, and I shall unsheathe a sword after them.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And you shall take from there a few by number, and you shall bind them in your skirts.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And you shall take more of them, and you shall cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them with fire; therefrom a fire will emerge to all the house of Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">So said the Lord God: This is Jerusalem; in the midst of the nations I have placed it, and around it are lands.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">But she exchanged My judgments for wickedness more than the nations, and My statutes, more than the lands that are around her, for they rejected My judgments, and as for My statutes, more than the lands that are around her, for they loathed My judgments, and as for My statutes-they did not follow them.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Therefore, so said the Lord God: Because you have prepared yourselves [to go astray] more than the nations that are around you; you did not follow My statutes and you did not perform My judgments; and like the customs of the nations that were around you, you did not do.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Therefore, so said the Lord God: Behold, I too am upon you, and I shall execute judgments in your midst before the eyes of the nations.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I shall do in you what I have not done and what I shall never do again, because of your abominations.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Thus fathers will eat children in your midst, and children will eat their fathers, and I shall execute judgments upon you, and I shall scatter your remnant to every direction.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I swear! because you have contaminated My sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations; I, too, shall diminish you and My eye will not spare you, and I, too, shall have no pity.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">A third of you will die through pestilence, and through hunger they will perish in your midst, and a third will fall around you by the sword, and a third I shall scatter to every direction, and I shall unsheathe a sword [in pursuit] after them.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And My wrath will be spent and I shall cause My fury against them to subside, and I shall be comforted, and they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken with My zeal, when I spend My fury upon them.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And I shall make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you; before the eyes of every passerby.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And she will be a reproach and a taunt, a chastisement, and an astonishment to the nations that are around you, when I execute in you judgments with wrath and with fury and with chastisements of fury-I, the Lord, have spoken.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">When I send forth the evil arrows of the famine in them, which became a destroyer, which I shall send forth to destroy you; and I shall add a famine upon you and break your staff of bread.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And I shall send forth upon you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you; and pestilence and blood shed will pass through you, and I shall bring the sword upon you.

On the Sabbath shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And as a meal- offering: one ephah for the ram; and for the lambs, a meal-offering as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">But on the New Moon; a young bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, without blemish are they to be.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And an ephah for the bull and an ephah for the ram he shall bring as a meal-offering, but for the lambs as much as he can afford, and of oil a hin to an ephah.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And whenever the prince goes in, he shall go in by way of the vestibule of the gate, and by the same way shall he go out.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the times fixed for meeting, he who enters by way of the north gate to prostrate himself shall go out by way of the south gate, and he that enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate; he shall not return by way of the gate whereby he came in, but he shall go out by that which is opposite it.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The prince also [then] enters among them when they go in, and when they go out, they [the prince and the people together] go out.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And on the Festivals and on the times fixed for meeting, the meal-offering shall consist of an ephah for a bull and an ephah for a ram, but for the lambs a gift which is in accordance with his means, and oil, a hin to an ephah.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And when the prince brings a free will-offering, a burnt-offering or a peace- offering as a free will-offering to the Lord, one shall then open for him the gate that faces east, and he shall bring his burnt-offering and his peace-offering as he does on the Sabbath day, and after he has gone out, one shall close the gate.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And a lamb of the first year, without blemish shall you bring as a burnt-offering daily to the Lord, every morning shall you bring it.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And as a meal-offering you shall bring for it every morning a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to stir [with] the fine flour; a meal-offering to the Lord, according to the perpetual ordinance.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Thus shall they bring the lamb and the meal-offering and the oil every morning, a continual burnt offering.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">So says the Lord God: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance and remains in his sons' possession; it is their property by inheritance</pasuk><pasuk id="17">But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his until the year of liberty, and then it comes back to the prince; only to his sons shall his inheritance belong.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">But the prince may not take of the people's inheritance to force them out of their possessions, only from his own possessions shall he give his sons inheritance, so that My people not be scattered each man from his inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now he brought me through the entry that was on the side of the gate to the chambers of the Sanctuary of the priests, which face northward, and behold there was a place at the end toward the west.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he said to me; This is the place where the priests shall cook the guilt-offering and the sin-offering and bake the meal-offering, so as not to bring [them] out to the Outer Court to mingle with the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he took me out to the Outer Court, and he led me past the four corners of the Court, and behold a court in the corner of the Court.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">In the four corners of the Court were open enclosures, forty in length and thirty in width, one measure for the four of them in the corners.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And a row [of masonry] around in them, around all four of them, and a place for cooking was made under the rows [of masonry] around.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And he said to me, "These are the cooking places where the ministrants of the House will cook the people's sacrifices."</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="47"><pasuk id="1">Then he brought me back to the entrance of the House, and behold there was water coming out from under the threshold of the House toward the east, for the House faced eastward, and the water was descending from below, from the right side of the House, from the south of the altar.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he took me out by way of the Northern Gate and led me around by way of the outside to the Outer Gate, the way that faces east, and behold, water was trickling from the right side.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">When the man went out eastward with a cord in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he measured one thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the knees, and he measured one thousand and he led me though water that reached the loins.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he measured one thousand [cubits], a stream that I could not cross, for the water was so high that it was water for swimming, a stream that could not be crossed.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And he said to me, "Have you seen, Son of man?" And he led me and brought me back upon the bank of the stream.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">When I returned, and behold, upon the bank of the stream was a very great profusion of trees on either side.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And he said to me, "This water is going out to the eastern frontier, and will descend upon the plain, and come to the sea, to the sea that is brought out, and the waters will be healed.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And every living creature that will swarm wherever the two streams will go, will live, and the fish will be very abundant, for these waters have come there, and wherever the stream flows, they shall be healed and live.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And it will be [a place] beside which fishermen will stand, from Ein-gedi to Ein-eglaim; a place for spreading nets they will be; their fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Its marshes and its pools will not be healed; they will be set aside for salt [mines].</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But by the stream, on its bank from either side, will grow every tree for food; its leaf will not wither, neither will its fruit end; month after month its fruits will ripen, for its waters will emanate from the Sanctuary, and its fruit shall be for food and its leaves for a cure.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">So said the Lord God: This is the border whereby you shall divide the land for inheritance to the twelve tribes of Israel, Joseph [taking two] portions.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And you shall inherit it, one as another, being that I lifted up My hand to give it to your forefathers, and this land shall be to you an inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And this is the border of the land: to the northern side, from the Great Sea the way to Hethlon to the road [leading] to Zedad.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath;
