      <text title="And it was after the death of Moses: ">This is connected to the order of the Torah which ends with Moses’ passing, and this follows it.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="Moses My servant has died: ">If he were alive, I would prefer him. The Rabbis interpret this passage as a reference, not to Moses the leader, but to Moses the Lawgiver, concerning the 3,000 laws that were forgotten during the period of mourning for Moses. Joshua came and asked the Lord to repeat these laws to him. Said to him the Holy One, Blessed be He: Moses My servant has died, and the Torah is called by his name, implying to you that it is impossible [to convey them to you.] Go out and occupy them with martial activities.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="Every place on which [the soles of your feet] will tread: ">A similar statement to this was said to Moses, concerning which we learned in Sifrei : If this verse is to teach about the boundaries of Eretz Israel, the Scripture already states: From this desert and Lebanon etc., [clearly defining the boundaries of the Holy Land.] If so, why is it stated, ‘Every place where your foot will tread?’ Even outside of Eretz Israel. [I.e.] After you have conquered the land, all that you will conquer outside the land, will be holy and will be yours.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="From this desert and Lebanon: ">[I.e.] the Desert of Kadesh, the Desert of Zin [that is near Edom], which was in the southeastern corner, through which they entered the land, as it is stated: And behold, we are in Kadesh. Now, whence is it derived that it was in the southeast? For it is stated: And the south side shall be to you from the desert of Zin near Edom etc.</text>
      <text title="to the great river, the Euphrates: ">This is its width from south to North.</text>

      <text title="Did I not command you, be strong and have courage: ">in war; as it is stated: Do not fear and not be dismayed. Now, when did he command him? In Moses’ time, as it is stated: “And command Joshua, etc.”</text>

      <text title="And Joshua [the son of Nun] sent [two men out of Shittim to spy]: ">Against my will I must say that he dispatched them during Moses’ mourning period, for after three days following the termination of Moses’ mourning period, they crossed the Jordan, for thence we deduced that Moses died on Adar 7 by counting back thirty-three days from the day they came up from the Jordan, namely, the tenth day of the first month. Now, of necessity, from the time the spies were dispatched, they did not cross the Jordan until the fifth day, as it is stated: and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. On that night they crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they moved from Shittim, here is a fourth day. And they lodged there before they crossed over. Hence, they did not cross until the fifth day.</text>
      <text title="secretly: ">Secretly. So did Jon. render it. He said to them: Disguise yourselves as deaf-mutes (חרשים) so that they will not conceal their affairs from you. Another explanation is: חרש [with a “shin”] is like חרש [with a “sin” or “samech,” namely pottery.] Load yourselves with pots so that you appear as potters.</text>
      <text title="and see the land and Jericho: ">Now, was Jericho not included in the generalization? Why, then, is it specifed? Because it was as strong as all of them [the cities combined], it was situated on the boundary. Similarly, and there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. Now, was Asahel not included in the generalization? Why, then, was he specified? Because he was as strong as all of them [combined]. Similarly, and King Solomon loved many foreign wives and Pharaoh’s daughter. Now, was Pharaoh’s daughter not included in the generalization? Why, then, was she specified? Because he loved her as much as all of them [combined]. And regarding the sin, since she caused him to sin more than all of them. This was taught in Sifrei.</text>

[In this case,] because she hastened to hide them, and [she hid them] in a narrow place as though they were one man. The Agadic Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma states: They were Phinehas and Caleb, and Phinehas stood before them, yet they did not see him because he was like an angel. Another explanation is: And she hid him, [i.e.,] each one by himself. And we have found the like thereof: Oil and incense make joyful the heart. (ישמח לב), sing. form.) And it is not written ישמחו לב (plural form), [implying that each one makes the heart joyful.]</text>

      <text title="and the priests the Levites: ">[This is explained in inverted order.] Since they are all descended from Levi, Amram’s grandfather, they are called Levites, as our Sages explain in Gen.

      <text title="And it was, when all the people had completely passed over, that the Ark passed over, etc.: ">not after the manner in which the others had passed over, but as it is explained below in this episode, the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up backwards to the dry land on the bank from which they had entered, beside which they were standing, and the waters returned backwards to flow as it had done heretofore. Hence, the Ark and its bearers are found to be on one side, and all Israel on the other side. The Ark picked up its bearers and passed over.</text>

      <text title="that they come up out of the Jordan: ">that they cross, is not written here, but “that they come up.” Hence, we deduce that they came up on the bank beside which they were standing. And it is impossible to say that they were standing beside the western bank of the Jordan, for it is stated above: The feet of the priests were dipped in the edge of the water. And there it is stated: And the priests stood and all Israel passed.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="18">
      <text title="the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up: ">from the water to the dry land which was beside them, and the waters returned to their place. Hence, the Ark is found to be on one side and Israel on the other side. Accordingly, the Ark lifted its bearers and passed over. And concerning this matter, Uzzah was punished when he took hold of the Ark. If it bore its bearers, can it not be deduced by a fortiori conclusion that it can bear itself?</text>

      <text title="the second time: ">for they had already circumcised a large assembly on the night of their departure from Egypt, and this was the second time, for the entire forty years that they were in the desert, the north wind did not blow for them, and they did not have any day suitable for circumcision, as we learned in Job. Our Rabbis state, however, “ ‘the second time’ refers the uncovering the corona at circumcision,” [i.e. splitting the membrane and pulling it back] which Abraham was not commanded to do.</text>

      <text title="Now this is the reason: ">Through speech he circumcised them. He said to them, “Do you expect to inherit the land while being uncircumcised?

We see it over you in the desert.” And that is what Moses said in the desert, “Why should the Egyptians say, With ‘Ra-ah’ He took them out.” But they did not know that that was the blood of circumcision. And when they circumcised in Joshua’s time, and that blood came, that reproach was removed, for the vast multitude which had gone up with them were still vexing them. In this manner, Rabbi Moses the preacher expounded.</text>
      <text title="have I rolled away: ">גלותי - I have removed, like “(גל) Remove [or roll away] from me reproach and shame.” “ (ויגל) and he rolled off [or removed] the stone.”</text>

      <text title="on the morrow of the Passover: ">the day of the waving of the 'Omer, for first they sacrificed the 'Omer. And from the seventh of Adar, when Moses died, whereupon the manna ceased to fall, they subsisted on the manna which was in their vessels, which they had gathered on the seventh of Adar, as it is stated: “the manna they ate forty years.” Now, was it not forty years less thirty days, for the beginning of the falling of the manna was on the fifteenth of Iyar? Hence we deduce that in the cakes which the Israelites took with them from Egypt they perceived the taste of manna.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="12">
      <text title="neither had the children of Israel manna anymore: ">Therefore, they ate of the grain of the Land. Had they still had manna, they world not have eaten of the grain, for the manna was pleasing to them. An appropriate parable is: One says to a child, why do you eat barley bread? Because he has no wheat bread. Therefore, it is stated: “Neither had the children of Israel manna anymore, etc.”</text>
