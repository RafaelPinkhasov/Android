<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel in the hand of Malachi.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">I loved you, said the Lord, and you said, "How have You loved us?" Was not Esau a brother to Jacob? says the Lord. And I loved Jacob.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And I hated Esau, and I made his mountains desolate and his heritage into [a habitat for] the jackals of the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Should Edom say, "We were poor, but we will return and build the ruins"? So said the Lord of Hosts: They shall build, but I will demolish; and they shall be called the border of wickedness and the people whom the Lord has damned forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, "The Lord is great beyond the border of Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">A son honors a father, and a slave his master. Now if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My fear? says the Lord of Hosts to you, the priests, who despise My name. But you said, "How have we despised Your Name?"</pasuk><pasuk id="7">You offer on My altar defiled food, yet you say, "How have we defiled You?" By your saying, "God's table is contemptible."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">When you offer a blind [animal] for a sacrifice, is there nothing wrong? And when you offer a lame or a sick one, is there nothing wrong? Were you to offer it to your governor, would he accept you or would he favor you? says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And now, will you pray before the Lord that He be gracious to us? This has come from your hand. Will He favor any of you? says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">O that there were even one among you that would close the doors [of the Temple] and that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain! I have no desire in you, says the Lord of Hosts. Neither will I accept an offering from your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">For, from the rising of the sun until its setting, My Name is great among the nations, and everywhere offerings are burnt and offered up to My Name; yea, a pure oblation, for My Name is great among the nations, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But you are profaning it by your saying, "The Lord's table is defiled"; and its expression is "Its food is contemptible."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And you say, "Here is a weary one," and you cause it pain, says the Lord of Hosts. And you brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame and the sick. And you bring an offering-will I accept it from your hand? says the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And cursed is he who deals craftily; although there is a ram in his flock, he vows and sacrifices a blemished one. For I am a great King, says the Lord of Hosts, and My Name is feared among the nations.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">And now, to you is this commandment, O priests.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">If you do not heed, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My Name, says the Lord of Hosts, I will send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed I have [already] cursed it, for you do not take it to heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Behold! I rebuke the seed because of you, and I will scatter dung upon your face-the dung of your festive sacrifices, and it shall take you to itself.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And you shall know that I have sent you this commandment, that My covenant be with Levi, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">My covenant was with him, life and peace, and I gave them to him [with] fear; and he feared Me, and because of My Name, he was over-awed.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">True teaching was in his mouth, and injustice was not found on his lips. In peace and equity he went with Me, and he brought back many from iniquity.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">For a priest's lips shall guard knowledge, and teaching should be sought from his mouth, for he is a messenger of the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">But you have turned aside from the way. You caused many to stumble in the Torah. You corrupted the covenant of the Levites, said the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And now I, too, have made you contemptible and low to the entire people according to how you do not keep My ways and [how] you show favoritism in the Torah.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why should we betray, each one his brother, to profane the convenant of our forefathers?</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holy one of the Lord [in] that he loved and married the daughter of a foreign god.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">From the man who commits it, the Lord shall cut off one of acuity or erudition from the tents of Jacob and one who offers up an offering to the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And this second thing you do, to cover the altar of the Lord with tears, weeping, and sighing-such that He will no longer turn to the offering, nor will He take anything willingly from your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And you will say, "Why?"-Because the Lord testified between you and the wife of your youth, that you dealt treacherously with her, and she is your companion and the wife of your covenant.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now did He not make one who had the rest of the spirits? Now what does the one seek of the seed of God? Now you shall beware of your spirit, that it shall not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">If you hate [her], send [her] away, says the Lord God of Israel. For injustice shall cover his garment, said the Lord of Hosts, but you shall beware of your spirit, and do not deal treacherously.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you say, "How have we wearied [Him]?"-By your saying, "Every evildoer is good in the Lord's sight, and He desires them," or, "Where is the God of judgment?"</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">Behold I send My angel, and he will clear a way before Me. And suddenly, the Lord Whom you seek will come to His Temple. And behold! The angel of the covenant, whom you desire, is coming, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Now who can abide the day of his coming, and who will stand when he appears, for it is like fire that refines and like fullers' soap.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And he shall sit refining and purifying silver, and he shall purify the children of Levi. And he shall purge them as gold and as silver, and they shall be offering up an offering to the Lord with righteousness.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasant to the Lord, as in the days of old and former years.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And I will approach you for judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely; and also against those who withhold the wages of the day laborers, of the widow and fatherless, and those who pervert [the rights of] the stranger, [and those who] fear Me not, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For I, the Lord, have not changed; and you, the sons of Jacob, have not reached the end.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">From the days of your fathers you have departed from My laws and have not kept [them]. "Return to Me, and I will return to you," said the Lord of Hosts, but you said, "With what have we to return?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Will a man rob God? Yet you rob Me, and you say, "With what have we robbed You?"-With tithes and with the terumah-levy.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">You are cursed with a curse, but you rob Me, the whole nation!</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Bring the whole of the tithes into the treasury so that there may be nourishment in My House, and test Me now therewith, says the Lord of Hosts, [to see] if I will not open for you the sluices of heaven and pour down for you blessing until there be no room to suffice for it.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, and he will not destroy the fruits of your land; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And then all the nations shall praise you, for you shall be a desirable land, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">"Still harder did your words strike Me," says the Lord, but you say, "What have we spoken against You?"</pasuk><pasuk id="14">You have said, "It is futile to serve God, and what profit do we get for keeping His charge and for going about in anxious worry because of the Lord of Hosts?"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And now we praise the bold transgressors. Yea, those who work wickedness are built up. Yea, they tempt God, and they have, nevertheless, escaped.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then the God-fearing men spoke to one another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it. And a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who feared the Lord and for those who valued His name highly.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, for that day when I make a treasure. And I will have compassion on them as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who has not served Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">For lo, the sun comes, glowing like a furnace, and all the audacious sinners and all the perpetrators of wickedness will be stubble. And the sun that comes shall burn them up so that it will leave them neither root nor branch, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the sun of mercy shall rise with healing in its wings for you who fear My Name. Then will you go forth and be fat as fatted calves.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And you shall crush the wicked, for they will be as ash under the soles of your feet on the day that I will prepare, says the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Keep in remembrance the teaching of Moses, My servant-the laws and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Lo, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord,</pasuk><pasuk id="24">that he may turn the heart of the fathers back through the children, and the heart of the children back through their fathers-lest I come and smite the earth with utter destruction.</pasuk></chapter></book>
