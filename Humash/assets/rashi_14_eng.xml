      <text title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year: ">The prophet presented his words obscurely and did not tell his name, who he was; nor did he explain from what date he was counting. Therefore, the holy spirit interrupted his words in the following two verses to teach [us] who the prophet was and to teach [us] from what date he was counting. As it is said: “On the fifth day of the monththat is the fifth year, etc.” These are not the words of the prophet, for he already stated that he was standing on the fifth of the month, and furthermore, from the beginning he had stated his prophecy in the first person: “and I was in the midst of the exile” ; “and I saw visions of God.” And so at the end: “And I saw, and behold, a storm wind, etc.” Now these [next] two verses interrupted his words, as though someone else was speaking about him: “The word of the Lord was [revealed] to Ezekiel… and the hand of the Lord came upon him there.”</text>
      <text title="as I was in the midst of the exile: ">i.e., outside the land of Israel.</text>
      <text title="by the river Chebar: ">The name of the river.</text>
      <text title="visions of God: ">Heb. מַרְאוֹת. Because he did not see with a “lucid speculum,” he calls it “visions of God,” a sort of dream, insubstantial. All the prophets also saw through a “dim speculum,” except for our teacher Moses. That is what is said (Hos. 12:11): “and to the prophets, I assumed likenesses.”</text>

      <text title="that is the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile: ">Thus, we may deduce that the thirty years he counted, he counted from the beginning of the jubilee [cycle]: the last jubilee commenced at the beginning of the eighteenth year of Josiah[‘s reign]; that is, the year that Hilkiah found the scroll (II Kings 22). So we learn in Seder Olam (ch. 26), that the beginning of the jubilee was that [year]. Josiah reigned thirty one years. Subtracting from them the seventeen years that had already passed leaves fourteen years. Jehoiakim reigned eleven years; [together, that] totals twenty-five years. Jeconiah [Jehoiachin] his son, had reigned only three months when he was exiled, and the year that Ezekiel prophesied was the fifth [year] of his exile, hence the thirtieth year of the jubilee. And so we find that at the end of his prophecy, he gives a sign using the count of the jubilee [as a reference], for it says (40:1): “In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month.” Our Rabbis said (Arachin 12a): What “year” is it that begins on the tenth of the month? You must say that this is the jubilee year [See Leviticus 25:9f.].</text>

    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="The word of the Lord was [revealed]: ">Heb. הָיֹה הָיָה [lit. being was.] Our Sages said (Mechilta to Exod. 12:1): “[It] had already come,” because the Shechinah does not rest upon a prophet outside the [Holy] Land, except by having first rested upon him in the Land. We learned in a Baraitha of the Mechilta (Exod. 15:9): [The verse 2:1,] “Son of man, stand on your feet,” was the [actual] beginning of the Book, only there is no chronological order [in Scripture]. Others say that (12:1f.) “Son of man, compose a riddle,” is the [true] beginning of the Book. [Mechilta ends here.] I say that this prophecy was told to him before they were exiled, because it is appropriate to be said to him in the Land, for the community of the exile is not mentioned explicitly in it. It can be recognized as the beginning of his mission to them. Jonathan, too, paraphrased in that manner: The prophetic word from before the Lord was revealed to Ezekiel the son of Buzi the priest in the land of Israel; it returned a second time and spoke with him in the state of the land of the Chaldeans. Now Ezekiel was exiled with the “craftsmen and the sentries of the gates,” who were exiled with Jehoiachin.</text>
      <text title="the hand of the Lord: ">Every expression of יַד mentioned in this Book or in any expression of prophecy is invariably an expression of compulsion, [implying] that the prophecy seizes him against his will, like a person going mad, destreze in Old French, compulsion.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="and behold, a tempest was coming from the north: ">That is the Chariot of the throne of the glory of the Shechinah, as it is described in this chapter (verse 28). Since it came with fury to destroy Israel, it is therefore likened to a tempest and a [storm] cloud.</text>
      <text title="coming from the north: ">It was returning from the land of the Chaldeans, which is in the north. As it is said (Jer. 1:14): “From the north the misfortune will break forth.” And why did it go there [first]? In order to subjugate the whole world to Nebuchadnezzar, to prevent the nations from saying that He delivered His children into the hands of a lowly nation, for the Chaldeans were [considered] a lowly nation. As it is said (Isa. 23:13): “this people has never been.” So did our Sages expound on this verse in tractate Chagigah (13b).</text>
      <text title="with a brightness around it: ">Surrounding the cloud on the outside, implying that Israel was destined to be redeemed from there [Babylonia].</text>
      <text title="it was like the color of the chashmal: ">“Chashmal” is an angel bearing that name, and he [Ezekiel] saw [something] like the appearance of its color in the midst of the fire. And so did our Sages say: There was an incident involving a child who was expounding on the account of the Chariot. He perceived the meaning of “chashmal,” [whereupon] fire emanated from the chashmal and consumed him. They said further that the word itself is a combination: When they asked, “What is chashmal?” replied Rav Judah, “Living beings (חֶיוֹת) of fire (אֵש) that speak (מִמַלְלוֹת).” In a Baraitha we learned: Sometimes silent (חָשּׁוֹת), sometimes speaking (מִמַלְלוֹת) when the speech emanates from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they remain silent. When the speech does not emanate from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they speak; that is, they laud and praise the Lord (Chag. 13). [Addendum: Possibly, “chashmal” is the name of the color resembling the color of fire, for he said, “Chashmal from the midst of the fire,” and he said (verse 27): “the color of chashmal, the appearance of fire within it found about, from the appearance of his loins and above.” And, he says in the second vision (8:2): “and from his loins and above was like the appearance of a splendor, like the color of chashmal.”] And from the midst of it, [i.e.,] that fire, I saw something like the color of chashmal that appeared from the midst of the fire. But we do not know what it is, and the midrash that our Sages expounded on it, [defining “chashmal” as] living beings of fire that speak, does not seem to me to the context.</text>

      <text title="they had the likeness of a man: ">This is surprising, because they had also the likeness of an ox, a lion, and an eagle! Apparently, since this [being] is the patron of them all [all the living beings], the prophet praises the Chariot with it. [Their human face] had the countenance of our father Jacob.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="and each one had four faces: ">“Each one” means that the human countenance had four faces, as did that of the lion, the eagle, and the ox, totaling sixteen [faces] to one living being. It was thus for each living being, and four wings for each of the faces, totaling sixty-four wings for each living being. This is [why] Jonathan paraphrased: two hundred fifty-six wings.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="were straight legs: ">[Jonathan renders]: רִגְלִין כֵּיוָנָן parallel legs, this one opposite this one. Another explanation: “straight,” meaning they had no knee joints by which to bend their legs because they do no sitting or lying. Therefore they do not require joints like those of animalsthe upper joint and the lower joint by which it bends its legs to lie down.</text>
      <text title="a round foot: ">Heb. עֵגֶל, a round foot, and so did Jonathan render it: round feet.</text>
      <text title="and they sparkled: ">Because of their brilliance, sparks seemed to emanate from them, as we say in tractate Yoma (37b): She too [Queen Helene] made a golden candelabrum, etc. When the sun shone, sparks would [seemingly] emanate from it, etc. וְנוֹצְצִים is etincelants in French, gleaming.</text>
      <text title="like the color: ">Heb. כְּעֵין, like מַרְאֶה, the appearance.</text>
      <text title="burnished copper: ">Heb. קָלָל, clarified and gleaming. Menachem (Machbereth p. 155) associated it with (Lev. 2:14): “roasted (קָלוּי) in fire.”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="And human hands were beneath their wings: ">As the Targum paraphrases: to pick up coals of fire with them, etc. Likewise, we find in this Book (10: 7): “And the cherub stretched forth his hand, etc. to the fire that was between the cherubim, and he picked it up and gave it to the hands of the one dressed in linen.” And so, [in the verse] after it, “And there appeared to the cherubim the form of a human hand, etc.” The human hands pick up the fire and give it to the cherub, and the cherub [gives it] to the messenger, in order [to allow] the coals to cool off [as they pass] from hand to hand, to mitigate Israel’s punishment.</text>
      <text title="on their four sides: ">To the four directions of the world, for they have faces and wings in every direction.</text>
      <text title="and their faces and their wings were the same to all four of them: ">As the Targum renders: were the same to all four of them.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="Their wings joined one to the other: ">Each one’s wing was spread out to the side of the other one’s wing this way [lit. to here] and that way [lit. to here] until they join and touch each other, thereby covering their faces, for the wings are spread out over the face.</text>
      <text title="they did not turn when they walked: ">If they wished to walk in any desired direction, they did not need to turn their faces because they have faces on every side; therefore each one went in the direction of his facein the direction of the face on that side where they desired to go, they would go.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="11">
      <text title="And so were their faces, and their wings were extended upward: ">Had I not seen the cantillation sign of a “zakef gadol” [indicating a pause] punctuating “And so were their faces,” I would not know how to explain it, but the punctuation taught me to separate them [the words of the verse] one from the other and to place the word וּפְנֵיהֶם by itself. And so, [this] is its explanation: And they had faces and their wings were extended above their faces and covered them. How so? “Each had two wings joined to each other” to each face, their two wings were joined. On each one, the wing of this living being was stretched out towards the side of that living being, and this one’s towards the side of this one, and the face that was in between was covered by them. [A verse whose wording] is similar to the language of this verse appears again in this chapter (verse 18): “And they had backs, and they were very high and they were dreadful.” The word וְגֲבֵּיהֶן, “and they had backs,” stands by itself.</text>
      <text title="and two covering their bodies: ">And the two remaining wings would cover their bodies.</text>

      <text title="wherever would be the will: ">Heb. רוּחַ, usually spirit, here means will: the will to go.</text>

      <text title="it was going among the living beings: ">That appearance (מַרְאָה) was going among all the living beings.</text>
      <text title="there was a brightness to the fire: ">More than [there is to] our fire.</text>

    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="14">
      <text title="would run and return, like the appearance of the sparks: ">Our Sages explained (Chag. 13b): They would run and return like the flame of a furnace, which constantly shoots out of the mouth of the furnace and hastens back to enter. So, when they would thrust their heads out from under the expanse that was extended above themas is delineated in the chapterthey would recoil because of the Shechinah, which is above the expanse, and they hasten to pull their heads [down].</text>
      <text title="like the appearance of the sparks: ">Heb. הֲבָּזָק, de l’etincelle in French, and the color of their fire is like the color of the fire that emanates from between the shards within which gold is refined in a furnace. The fire that emanates from there is colored with these colors (ibid.). [Addendum: Others explain הַבָּזָק as an expression of scattering, as our Sages explained it (Gen. Rabbah 50:1): “like the appearance of the bazak” R. Judah in the name of R. Simon in the name of R. Levi the son of Perata: Like one who scatters (הַבּוֹזֵק) ‘gefeth’ in a stove, i.e., he scatters ‘gefeth’ the residue of olives in a stove: it ignites quickly and raises a flame, and the flame ascends and descends, and this is the meaning of “would run and return.” Furthermore we find in their words (Sanh. 108b, according to Aruch) בזק used as an expression of scattering: “He scattered (בָּזַק) dust on them and it turned into swords,” meaning he scattered, and so in the Mishnah (Eruvin 10: 14): “We may scatter (בּוֹזְקִין) salt on the ramp so that they should not slip.” בזק may also be defined as ברק (lightning), which is an expression of searching.]</text>

      <text title="three hundred and ninety days: ">We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 26): This teaches us that Israel sinned for three hundred and ninety years from the time they entered the Land until the ten tribes were exiled therefrom. You find [the events of] two hundred and forty-three of them delineated: From the time Jeroboam assumed the throne until Hoshea son of Elah was exiled and in “the days that the judges judged” are one hundred and eleven years. The rest, however, are not delineated. (These are [the calculations of] the three hundred and ninety yearsthat I found in a responsum from Rabbi Joseph, the head of the yeshivahthat the ten tribes sinned from the days of Joshua until Sannecherib exiled them from Samaria. Calculate: in the days of the Judges there were 8 years under the rule of Cushan, 18 under the rule of Eglon, 20 under the rule of Sisera, 7 under the rule of Midian, 18 under the rule of the children of Ammon, and 40 under the rule of the Philistines. This totals 111. From Micah until the Ark was captured were 40 years, totaling 151. Calculate for Jeroboam son of Nebat 22, Nadab his son 2, Baasa 24, Elah his son 2, Omri 12, Ahab 22, Ahaziah his son 2, Jehoram his brother 12, Jehu 28, Jehoahaz 17, Jehoash his son 16, Jeroboam his son 41the total is 350 (sic.). And [with] Menachem son of Gadi 10, Pekahiah his son 2, Pekah son of Remaliah 20, and Hoshea son of Elah 9 years, the total is 391, but Hoshea’s last year is not counted because in Hoshea’s ninth year, Samaria was captured and Hoshea was counted as having reigned 8 years, leaving a total of 390. The forty years that the kings of Judah sinned after the exile of Sannecherib until [the prophecy of] this chapter was said to Ezekiel are delineated below, and I did not find it necessary to explain them. This is not found in other editions.)</text>

      <text title="the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: ">This teaches us that the house of Judah sinned, from the time that the ten tribes were exiled until Jerusalem was destroyed, forty years: 22 of Manasseh, about whom it is written (II Kings 21:3): “as Ahab… had made,” and Ahab had reigned 22 years; two of Ammon and 11 of Jehoiakim, and this prophecy was transmitted to Ezekiel in the fifth year of Zedekiah. This totals 40 years. The grand total is four hundred and thirty [years]. After this prophecy, they remained yet six years, equaling 8 jubilees and 36 years. In 8 jubilees [there] are 8 cycles of Sabbatical years, equaling 56 Sabbatical years, totaling 64 [hallowed years]. In 36 years, there are 5 Sabbatical years, totaling 69 land-release years, and the final jubilee year is accounted to them as an iniquity because they were exiled from it [the land] because of their iniquity, totaling 70 hallowed years of land release, which Israel did not observe. Therefore, they were exiled 70 years to fulfill (Lev. 26:34): “Then the land will appease its Sabbaths.” That is what is written at the end of Chronicles (II 36:21): “To fulfill the word of the Lord [that was] in the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land has appeased its Sabbaths, for as long as it lay desolate, it rested, to complete seventy years.” “Your left side” symbolizes Samaria; “your right side” symbolizes Judah, because Judah is in the south of the land of Israel, as it is said (16:46): “And your big sister Samaria… who lives at your left.” Also in the Book of Joshua (15:1), he describes the border of the tribe of Judah as occupying the entire southern border.</text>

      <text title="Noah, Daniel, and Job: ">Because each of these three saw three worlds: Noah saw the world built up, destroyed, and rebuilt; and Danielthe Temple. Or himself: first a prince over all the princes, eventually cast into a lions’ den, and [ultimately] restored to his greatness. Likewise, Job saw himself well-established, destroyed, and [again] well-established. Therefore, they were brought as a parallel to the generation of Jeconiah, which saw the Temple while it was built and while it was destroyed, and the [Temple’s] second building. And the Holy One, blessed be He, said the following to them: “I am showing you great affectionyou, Jeconiah and [those of] his exile. Should one of the lands of the nations sin against Me and had I decreed upon it one of these four punishmentseither ” famine “ (verse 13), ” wild beast “ (verse 15), ” the sword “ (verse 17),” or pestilence" (verse 19) as they appear in this chapter, consecutively, and these three righteous men were in its midst, they would save neither son nor daughter. Yet I will bring [all] four of them on [your brethren in] Jerusalem, and [still] leave over for you some of your sons who are there although you are not in its midst. And not because they are worthy of being saved, but to console you when they are exiled [to an area] near you and you will see their evil deeds and be consoled about the evil that I brought upon them. For you will see that it could no longer be tolerated. [The annotator of our ms. remarks:] (This is the theme of this entire chapter. This [following] explanation cannot be made fit, and it appears that it is not the wording of the rabbi [viz. Rashi]. It appears further that this edition [of Rashi in which this comment was found] is missing one of the four punishments, from אוֹ, or, until כִּי or.) Another explanation:</text>
      <text title="If a land sins against Me, etc.: ">and had these three men been in its midst [namely] Noah, Daniel, and Job because the Holy One, blessed be He, saved these three men from these three [four] judgments, Scripture mentioned these. Noah was saved from the three of them. How do we know [that he was saved] from wild beasts? When he entered the ark, all the beasts attempted to enter, but the Holy One, blessed be He, did not allow them, as it is written (Gen. 7:16): “and the Lord shut around him.” Now the word “shut” refers only to protection from beasts, as Scripture states (Dan. 6:23): “and he shut the lions’ mouths, and they did not hurt me.” A lion came to enter [the ark] and its teeth were set on edge; a bear came to enter, and its feet would totter, etc. (see Gen. Rabbah 31:12). How do we know [that he was saved] from famine?For it is said (Gen. 5:29): “from the soil, which the Lord has cursed.” Go out and learn Genesis Rabbah (25:3) where it enumerates the ten famines that descended upon the world, and you will find that one of them was in the time of Noah, and it brings proof from “from the soil, which… [He] cursed.” From the swordthis is the Flood, and moreover, the people of his generation sought to attack him, saying, “We will not allow him to enter,” but the Holy One, blessed be He, saved him: said the Holy One, blessed be He, “I will not allow him to enter except at midday [in broad daylight], and whomever it hurtslet him protest.” That is what is written (Gen. 7:13): “In this very (עֶצֶם) day Noah came [into the ark]” at the strong point (עֱצוּמוֹ) of the day. Danielwhen Nebuchadnezzar entered the Temple in the days of Jehoiakim, he slew Jehoiakim and spared Daniel. He expelled Daniel [into] a peaceful exile because he found him to be full of a spirit of wisdom. From faminefor until Jerusalem was conquered in the days of Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar besieged it for three years [during which it suffered a famine], as is said (II Kings 25:3): “the famine became severe in the city,” and also (in Jer. 52:6): “and the famine became severe.” How do we know [that he was saved] from beasts?“ and shut the lions’ mouths (Dan. ibid.), and they did not hurt me.” Likewise, you find that Job was saved from the three of them. How do we know [that he was saved] from famine? According to the one who says (Baba Bathra 15b) that Job lived in the time of Jacob, we find that there was a famine in his days. How do we know [that he was protected] from beasts?For it is written (Job 1:10): “and his cattle has broken out into the land.” It has breached the [natural] limitations of the world. [Usually wolves kill goats, but Job’s goats killed wolves; B. B. 15b.] How do we know [that he survived] the sword?(ibid. 16:13) “He splits my kidneys and does not have compassion.”</text>
      <text title="Now should these three men be in its midst [namely] Noah, Daniel, and Job, they would save themselves with their righteousness.: ">Why are sons and daughters not mentioned [in verse 14] in regard to the death by faminei.e., it is not stated about them, “[as I lived] if they will save sons or daughters!” as they are mentioned in the last two punishments (verses 16, 18)? This is to depict Daniel, for he was one of those three saved from famine, he was of the generation of Jeconiah, and neither sons nor daughters were rescued with him. Concerning him Isaiah prophesied (56:4): “[For] so says the Lord to the to the eunuchs who will keep My Sabbaths.”</text>

Jonathan also rendered it “they will not exist,” but the rest of the verse he did not render in this [i. e., Rashi’s] way, but so it appears to me. I heard many explanations for it, and I saw [others] in books of interpretations, but they did not appear correct to me, and the ‘payat’ who composed for Chanukah [for the morning of the first Sabbath]: “That which disdained all wood stabbed the adulterer,” supports me, for he called the sword “that which disdained all wood.” Jonathan rendered in this manner: (verse 15) או ֹנָשִׂישׂ. because the tribe of the house of Judah and Benjamin rejoiced at the tribes of Israel when they were exiled for worshipping idols, and they returned to stray after wooden images. He, too, explains או ֹנָשִׂישׂ as a rhetorical question.</text>
      <text title="For a test: ">and what if also a rod that disdains He will not be [Jonathan renders:] “For the prophets prophesied about them but they did not repent.” That is to say, the matter is already determined that they will not repent. And what will be their end?</text>

I shall further interpret it in another manner:</text>
      <text title="Or shall we rejoice, etc.: ">Or perhaps we should rejoice, for you say to Me that the tribe of My son disdains all wood: The kings of Judah disdain idolatry, as we find with Abijah, who said (II Chron. 13:8): “and with you are the golden calves,” and Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, who abolished all the idolatry in the world that was under their control, and these [the remaining tribes] too will repent.</text>
      <text title="Cry and wail: ">and do not rejoice over this, for it will be upon My people. And why?</text>
      <text title="Because it is tested: ">The matter is already tested and determined before Me that they will not repent properly.</text>
      <text title="And what if even they disdain wood, it will not be: ">And what if I wait longer? Even if they came to repent and to disdain idolatry, the matter would not last with them because they would hasten to revert to their wickedness.

      <text title="and to increase the stumbling blocks: ">Heb. וְהַרְבֵּה, and to increase the stumbling blocks, and so every הַרְבֵּה in Scripture is an expression of increasing, an infinitive.</text>
      <text title="the scream of the sword: ">Heb. אִבְחֳת. Some interpret [this as] טִבְחַת, the slaughter of, the ‘teth’ in place of the ‘aleph,’ by the code of א -ט ב ח [whereby ‘aleph’ is interchangeable with ‘teth,’ ‘beth’ with ‘cheth,’ etc.] [This appears to be Jonathan’s interpretation.] Others interpret it as אִבְעַת an expression of בְּעָתָה [fright], but this cannot be because the ‘tav’ in אִבְחֳת is not part of the radical, and it comes only for the construct state, whereas the ‘tav’ in בְּעָתָה is a radical. Therefore, I say that אִבְחֳתחֶרֶב means the sounding of the voice of those slain by the sword, an expression of barking (נְבִיחָה) glapissement in French, yelping, for the ‘nun’ in נְבִיחָה is a defective radical, like the ‘nun’ in נְשִּׁיכָה biting, and the ‘aleph’ comes in its place, like (Job 13:17): “and… my speech (אַחְוָתִי) in your ears” ; (II Kings 4: 2), “except a jug (אָסוּ) of oil.” Menachem (p. 12) explained it as fear of the sword.

Jonathan renders: בִּחִטֵי רִיחוּשּׁ expression for a gathering of many numbers, troche in Old French, bundle, bunch. A similar word appears in Pesikta [d’Rav Kahana, p. 184b]: “Just as the myrtle is crowded (רָחוּשּׁ) with leaves, so was Leah crowded with sons.” But I do not know what it [wheat of Minnith] is. In the name of Rabbi Simon, I heard that he found in a Bible with a Jerusalem Targum בְּחִטֵי מִנִיתוּפַנַג rendered: בְּחוּשְּׁלָא וְקֲלְמָא. Now, שַּׁעֲרֵי דְחוּשְּׁלָא, which is found in the Talmud (Yoma 79a), is explained as: peeled barley. I say, however, that “Minnith” is an expression of portions (מָנוֹת) , prepared food. Even according to its vocalization with a “dagesh,” Jonathan is wont to translate a word sometimes according to its apparent meaning and sometimes according to its midrashic meaning. So did he render (below 39: 16): “And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah (הֲמוֹנָה).” Although we punctuate the name הֲמוֹנָה without a “mappiq hey” (הֱמוֹנָה) , [with a “mappiq hey” (pronounced) הֲמוֹנָה would mean “her multitude” with a silent “hey” it means simply “a multitude.”] Jonathan paraphrases: And also there, the slain of the city whose multitude is great will be cast.</text>

[Therefore,] I say that “On that day” refers back to the above section, (verse 13): “At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians.” That count ends in the year that Belshazzar assumed the throne, and we find in Daniel that in that year the kings of Persia began to gain strength, and downfall was decreed upon Babylon, as it is said (Dan. 7:1): “In the first year of Belshazzar,… Daniel saw a dream, etc.” ; (verse 4) “The first one was like a lion” - that is Babylon. And it is written (ad loc.): “I saw until its wings were plucked off, etc. (verse 5) And behold another, second beast, resembling a bear” that is Persia. And it is written (ad loc.) “And thus it was said to it, ‘Devour much flesh.’” i.e., seize the kingdom. And the kingdom of Persia was the blossoming of the horn of Israel, as it is said regarding Cyrus (Isa. 45:13): “He shall build My city and free My exiles.” Now, how do we know that the forty years of Egypt ended at that time? [The proof is that] Egypt was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the twenty-seventh [year] of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year that this prophecy was said to Ezekiel. Add forty years, and you have sixty-seven. Deduct from them forty-five for Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three for Evil-Merodach, as we say in Megillah (11b), one of these years counting for both [kings], as we say there: “they were incomplete years.”</text>

      <text title="thirteen cubits: ">ten corresponding to the span of the entrance plus a cubit and a half on this side and a cubit and a half on the other side. Now, do not wonder why in respect to the entrance he calls it width and in respect to the span of the hall he calls it length, because in respect to the entrance, its height and its length and the width is from post to post, but the hall, since the extension of the protrusion of its east to west span is less than the measure of its north to south span, as this is eight cubits and that is thirteen, he calls the larger measure “length.” And here is evidence for the matter: in the Temple of [the Book of] Kings (I 6:3): “And the hall before the Temple of the House, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof, beyond the breadth of the House.” We thus find that north-to-south is called breadth as regards the Temple, yet, as regards the hall, it is called length, because the east-to-west measurement of the Temple exceeded [its measurement] from north to south, and with the hall, it was the opposite.

As a result, they were recessed from the area of the [gate’s] entrance’s width, two and a half cubits to this side and two and a half cubits to this side.

The wall of the cell was five cubits thick, resulting in the thickness of the northern wall of the northern cell, a nd the thickness of the northern wall of the hall, ending opposite each other.

      <text title="an entrance opposite an entrance: ">The entrance of the cell that was next to the gate in the south was directed exactly opposite the entrance of the cell that was next to the gate in the north, for the six cells did not have an entrance in the outside wall, but the two cells nearest the gate had entrances facing the space between the two of them, and so he says below (verse 16): “and for their doorposts [facing] toward the ‘inward of the gate.’” This teaches us that their entrances faced the gate.</text>

Menahem (p. 180) interpreted שְּׁקֻפִים as being related to the word for looking (הַשְּׁקָפָה) , as in (Song 6:10) “Who is this who looks forth (הַנִשְּׁקָפָה) ” ; (Ps. 102:20) “For He has looked down (הִשְּׁקִיף) from His holy height.” He interprets [the word “lintel” in] (Exod. 12:22) “to the lintel (אֶל הַמַשְּׁקוֹף) ” also, as being related to the word for [over] looking.</text>

The edges of the entrances on each side of the entrance of the cell are the “posts.” And they had windows open to the intervening space - having the width of the gate - which intervened between the cells.

So we learned in Tractate Middoth [concerning the Second Temple] (4: 6): “The Heichal was 100 by 100, with a height of 100 cubits. (4: 7) From east to west, the Hall’s wall was 5 cubits and its width, 11; the wall of the Heichal was 6 cubits and its length was 40; the partition was 1 cubit; the Holy of Holies was 20 cubits; the wall of the Heichal was 6 cubits; the cell was 6 cubits; and the wall of the cell was 5 cubits.” Above, in this section, [which concerns the Third Temple] as well, all of their measurements are explained in the same way, except for the [single] cubit for the partition, concerning which it is written in this section (verse 3): “two cubits,” but counterbalancing that, it decreases the width of the cell by a cubit, for the cell in the Mishnah was 6 cubits wide and its wall was 5 [totaling 11 cubits], and here its width is 4 and its wall is 6 [totaling only 10 cubits] as it is written (verse 8): “the foundations of the cells were the full length of a rod,” and though higher up it became narrower and recessed a cubit, as it is written (verse 9): “and the wall of the cell was five cubits.”</text>

The three of them had the “sippim,” posts for their entrances, and the three of them had narrowing windows, and the three of them had “attikim.” I do not know what they are.

      <text title="And the doors had two doors each: ">The entrance of the Heichal had two pairs of doors, as we learned in Middoth (4:1): “It had four doors, two on the inner side and two on the outer side… The outside doors opened [swinging] into the entrance space, overlaying the thickness of the wall.” For it [the wall’s depth] was six cubits, and the door was five cubits wide, measuring half the width of the entrance, and was recessed a cubit within the doorpost, with the result that the thickness of the wall had five cubits exposed, and when the outside door was opened toward the inside, it would cover it; and the inner doors would [swing] open toward the interior of the House, covering up [the area of the doorpost] behind the doors, for the entire House was overlaid with gold except [for the area of the doorpost] the doors. Rabbi Yehudah says: Also the inner doors stayed within the entrance, and were in the form of double doors. And they would fold back upon one another. These were two and a half cubits, and these were two and a half cubits, and a half cubit of the doorpost was here and a cubit and a half of the doorpost here, as it is said: ‘And the doors had two doors [each], two turning doors, etc.’ Now this is its explanation: Both the inner doors and the outer doors stood in the area demarcated by the thickness of the wall. These were recessed one half cubit further in along the doorpost. The inner doors would open toward the outer doors, and the outer doors toward the inner doors. How so? Two doors of five cubits each would open one opposite the other along five cubits width of the thickness of the wall. They were composed of leaves, and at their midpoint they would fold back when they were opened, like the wooden tablets upon which [scribes] write using an iron stylus, which fold up one behind the other. The result is that when they were folded, they [each] stood at two and a half cubits, and when they were opened one against the other, they [together] covered five cubits of the thickness of the wall.</text>

      <text title="And he took me out: ">of the Inner Court.</text>
      <text title="to the Outer Court: ">through the Northern Gate mentioned above (40:35): The gate of the Inner Court was opposite the gate to the north, and it was situated in the middle of the length of the Israelites’ Court, which was one hundred cubits.</text>
      <text title="and he brought me to the chamber that was opposite, etc.: ">To one of the first chambers, or to the place of the chambers, chanbrediz in Old French, block of chambers. These are the chambers standing north of the House, separated twenty cubits from the cells, as is written above (41:10), “And between the chambers was a [space] twenty cubits wide surrounding the House.” Someone [standing in the inner court] would be unable to enter those chambers or the twenty [cubit] wide space between them and the cells except through the Outer Court, as is made clear below in this section. For he states that the Inner Court was one hundred [cubits] by one hundred [cubits] square before the House, to the east; and he states concerning the width of the eastern side of the House: “one hundred cubits.” Ergo, the width of the House blocked off the width of the Inner Court, and one could not enter the Inner [Court if he was starting] from the sides of the chambers of either the north or the south. Therefore, one had to come to those chambers by way of the outer Northern Court.</text>
      <text title="that was opposite the fortress: ">Those chambers were parallel to the entire one hundred cubit east-to-west length of the House, as is stated in the section concerning [the east-west length of] these chambers (verse 8): “and behold, facing the Temple was one hundred cubits.”</text>

      <text title="and opposite the balcony of the Outer Court: ">For [as] we stated above, the Court was encompassed by a surrounding balcony.</text>
      <text title="a pillar opposite a pillar: ">[Heb. אַתִּיק,] I do not know what this is.</text>
      <text title="A pillar opposite a pillar: ">An אַתִּיק is a pillar, as Rashi explained [on] (41:15): “and the pillars (וְהָאַתִּיקִים) were around the three of them,” i.e., they surrounded the “upper chambers” , [and he calls them upper ones because they are at the top of the (Temple) Mount, as Rashi explained regarding (verse 9):] “And below these chambers.”] And here is a running commentary [of these verses]: “And the uppermost chambers” (verse 5) which were at the height of the mountain - two of them were narrow i.e., they were not wide because the pillars would decrease them, for builders reinforce the work on their building by making pillars up to two thirds of the wall [which], from there on, slant to a point. Therefore, the third story was not narrow. This is what Scripture means (verse 6): “For they were three storied, and they did not have pillars” ; they did not need to be strengthened as did the lower ones. “And they did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts,” i.e., the pillars of these chambers were not like all other pillars, insofar as other pillars are established beside walls for reinforcement, whereas these were [set] within the thickness of the wall, and protruded outward and inward. Therefore, they consumed part of the building.“Therefore… were deprived” (verse 6) Targum renders, דְּחִיקָן, were pressed, since they were in the thickness of the wall, protruding outward and inward, strengthening the chambers.“the lowest and middle stories… of ground space” [Heb. מֵהָאָרֶץ, lit. from the ground] Toward the ground. This I found in the name of “a great oak.”) “three-storied” [Heb. בַּשְּׁלִשִּׁים,] threefold, implying that those chambers were threefold - three, one over another; and the verses indicate this too, for [Scripture] states (verse 5): “And the uppermost chambers were narrow… more than the lowest stories and the middle stories.” But I could not understand, regarding these three verses, what the meaning of “for the ‘attikim’ consumed” is. What were those “attikim” and how did they consume parts of the upper stories and not any of the lowest and middle stories? And the explanation he gives for the matter, viz. that “they had no pillars” - I do not know how to understand it. (And I had no teacher or aid concerning this entire edifice; only as they showed me from heaven.)</text>

    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits width to the innermost one, a pathway of one cubit: ">It appears to me that since the interior of [each side of] the Outer [Court] was one hundred [cubits] wide from north to south, and of these, the chambers were [occupying a] fifty [cubit] width, and before them was a fifty [cubit] space on the north - here is [already accounted for] the entire width of the Court. It is thus found that the entire width of the [Inner] Court was blocked off, i.e., there was no space between the chambers and the extremity of the depository for the knives, and there was no passageway through which to enter the twenty [cubit] space between the chambers and the cells; The twenty cubit space that intervened between the cells and the chambers consisted of the fifteen cubits that were behind the depository for the knives, and five cubits in addition to them. Now if you ask, “If so, there is a space of five cubits between the corner of [the depository for] the knives and the corner of the chambers?” [I will answer that] the thickness of the wall that intervenes between the Inner Court and the Outer Court blocks him from east to west. For its thickness is six cubits, and its end terminates at the corner [formed by] the end of the one hundred [cubit] length of the Inner Court [meeting] with the corner of the depository of the knives. Therefore, there can be no passageway to that space of twenty [cubits], either in the Inner [Court] or in the Outer [Court] unless there would be a diagonal entrance [inserted] - where the end of the wall between the two courts terminates - in the thickness of the wall, a cubit [wide], enough for a man to enter. One would enter into the five cubit space that is between the [the depository for] the knives and the wall of the Chamber, and [then] walk through that space, toward the west, ten cubits. There, the extension of the depository for the knives terminates, and one enters the twenty [cubits] wide space. This is the meaning of what it says, “a walk of ten cubits width [going] to the innermost one, a way of one cubit.” For he enters it by way of an entrance of one cubit, which [starts to] enter diagonally at the end of the wall. Now why does he call it “a walk of… width” ? Should he not say, “a walk of ten cubits length” ? Because regarding the housing for the knives, it refers to the width, since the housing for the knives is fifteen cubits from north to south and only ten cubits from east to west.</text>

Indeed, Hananiah the son of Hezekiah the son of Gurion is remembered for good, for he sat in his attic and expounded on it. But because of our iniquities, what he expounded on these sacrificeswhy a bull is brought on the fourteenth day of Nissanhas been lost to us. I say that perhaps he is dealing with the fourteenth of Nissan of the first Passover in which the fully erected House will be dedicated, and this bull will be brought in lieu of the calf born of cattle that Aaron offered up on the eighth of investiture (Lev. 9:2). [Scripture] tells us that if he will not have offered it up on the eighth day of investiture, he should offer it up on the fourteenth of Nissan in order that he should be initiated for the service before the Festival, for it is incumbent upon him [to bring] the sacrifices and the burnt offering of the appointed time, as is stated above (v. 17): “And the burnt offerings and the meal-offerings and the libations on the festivals… shall devolve on the prince, etc.”</text>

[I.e., if one bull is missing, the other one may be brought.] So we learned in Menahoth (45a); however, they did not bring proof from this verse but from the verse below (46:6): “But on the New Moon: a young bull from those without blemish, and six lambs and a ram.” But perhaps this too comes to teach the same thing, and this is its meaning: seven bulls and seven rams daily. By adding the sacrifices of each day on its day, they add up to seven bulls for the seven days.</text>

      <text title="and an ephah for a ram: ">This too is flour from which we extract two tenths of fine flour sifted thoroughly, as we learned (Men. 6:6): The two loaves were two tenths from three “se’ahs” .

      <text title="And these are the names of the tribes: ">The arrangement of the portions they divide among themselves; the place of each one.</text>
      <text title="From the northern end: ">Dan will receive the northern border from Hazer-enan, which is at the eastern corner, until the border of Damascus (in the northwestern corner).</text>
      <text title="and he shall have the eastern side to the sea: ">i.e., from the eastern side until the sea, Dan [shall have] one portion. Now, he delineated the length but not the width. In the Baraitha of Sifrei in the portion of Ha’azinu (Deut. 32:12), [it says]: “What is the reason for stating, ‘Judah: one portion; Dan: one portion; Asher: one portion?’ It is to teach us that Israel are destined to receive the length, from east to west, measuring 25,000 rods in width, which equal 75 mil.” Now from where did they learn this measurement? From the offering, which is like one of these portions, as is explained above (45:1,6). I found that the following is written: “the length is like one of the portions, and it has a width of 25,000 rods, and a length, from the western side to the eastern side, of twenty-five thousand rods.” [Now, 15, 000 rods] equal 150,000 cubits, for a rod equals six cubits, and every 2,000 cubits equals one mil as we find in Tractate Yoma (67a) regarding the ten sukkot [booths] from Jerusalem to the precipice-behold 150,000 cubits amount to 75 mils. This is what Rabbi Eliezer [Hakalir] established in the liturgical poem, entitled “When I take an appointed time” (the last poem for the second day of Succoth): “At the time of the division of her lands, like a row of a vineyard abroad, in the length from the eastern side to its ends, until the ocean are its commandments, with a width of seventy-five mils are its limits.” (Some editions read: Seventy-five mils to thirteen strips, between the strips of the tribes and the strips of the Sanctuary will amount to 975 mils. Now, according to the figure of 400 parasangs by 400 parasangs for the land of Israel, the mils amount to 1600 [not 975] according to the figuring of the Kalir, who said that four mils equal a parasang. Perhaps the mils of the computation by strips are larger, four of them not fitting into a parasang, and he therefore came to count two and a half mils to a parasang, by which 400 parasangs will equal 1,000 mils. However, the computation of the mils of a strip equal only 975 mils, still leaving the total 25 mils short. The sum of the liturgical poet’s mils of strips does not equal the sum of four hundred parasangs. And whence did Rabbi Eliezer learn that the length of the strips extended to the ocean, which is at the end of the world, whereas Scripture testifies that the western border is [only] until the Great Sea [the Mediterranean], which is quite a distance inland from the ocean?)</text>

[I will answer you that] this division is not like Joshua’s division, for this one is like the rows of a vineyard and all the portions are equal, whereas [in] Joshua’s division, the tribe of Judah had such a large portion that [its territory was] too much for it until Simeon took part of it as is said (Josh. 19:9): “Out of the lot of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon.” Therefore, the width of the portion that Judah received in the days of Joshua suffices now for the five remaining tribes to take a share of it, because its length was very great, from the eastern side to the ocean, and Jerusalem is located there.</text>
