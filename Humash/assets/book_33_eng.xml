<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">The words of Koheleth son of David, king in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Vanity of vanities, said Koheleth; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">What profit has man in all his toil that he toils under the sun?</pasuk><pasuk id="4">A generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth endures forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The sun rises and the sun sets, and to its place it yearns and rises there.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">It goes to the south and goes around to the north; the will goes around and around, and the will returns to its circuits.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full; to the place where the rivers flow, there they repeatedly go.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">All things are wearisome; no one can utter it; the eye shall not be sated from seeing, nor shall the ear be filled from hearing.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">There is a thing of which [someone] will say, "See this, it is new." It has already been for ages which were before us.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">[But] there is no remembrance of former [generations], neither will the later ones that will be have any remembrance among those that will be afterwards.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">I am Koheleth; I was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And I applied my heart to inquire and to search with wisdom all that was done under the heaven. It is a sore task that God has given to the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">I saw all the deeds that were done under the sun, and behold, everything is vanity and frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">What is crooked will not be able to be straightened, and what is missing will not be able to be counted.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">I spoke to myself, saying, "I acquired and increased great wisdom, more than all who were before me over Jerusalem"; and my heart saw much wisdom and knowledge.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I know that this too is a frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge, increases pain.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">I said to myself, "Come now, I will mix [wine] with joy and experience pleasure"; and behold, this too was vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Of laughter, I said, "[It is] mingled"; and concerning joy, "What does this accomplish?"</pasuk><pasuk id="3">I searched in my heart to indulge my body with wine, and my heart conducting itself with wisdom and holding onto folly, until I would see which is better for the children of men that they should do under the heavens, the number of the days of their lives.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">I made myself great works; I built myself houses, and I planted myself vineyards.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted in them all sorts of fruit trees.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">I made myself pools of water, to water from them a forest sprouting with trees.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">I acquired male and female slaves, and I had household members; also I had possession of cattle and flocks, more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">I accumulated for myself also silver and gold, and the treasures of the kings and the provinces; I acquired for myself various types of musical instruments, the delight of the sons of men, wagons and coaches.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">So I became great, and I increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And [of] all that my eyes desired I did not deprive them; I did not deprive my heart of any joy, but my heart rejoiced with all my toil, and this was my portion from all my toil.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Then I turned [to look] at all my deeds that my hands had wrought and upon the toil that I had toiled to do, and behold everything is vanity and frustration, and there is no profit under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And I turned to see wisdom and madness and folly, for what is the man who will come after the king, concerning that which they have already done?</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And I saw that wisdom has an advantage over folly, as the advantage of light over darkness.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">The wise man has eyes in its beginning, but the fool goes in the darkness, and I too know that one event happens to them all.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And I said to myself, "As it happens to the fool, so will it happen to me too, so why then did I become wiser?" And I said to myself that this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">For there is no remembrance of the wise man even as of the fool forever, seeing that in the coming days, all is forgotten. And how shall the wise die with the fool?</pasuk><pasuk id="17">So I hated the living, for the deed that was done under the sun grieved me, for everything is vanity and frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And I hated all my toil that I toil under the sun, that I should leave it to the man who will be after me.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish. And he will rule over all my toil that I have toiled and that I have gained wisdom under the sun; this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the toil that I toiled under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">For there is a man whose toil is with wisdom and with knowledge and with honesty and to a man who did not toil for it he will give it as his portion; this too is vanity and a great evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">For what has a man out of all his toil and the breaking of his heart that he toils under the sun?</pasuk><pasuk id="23">For all his days are pains and his occupation is vexation; even at night his heart does not rest; this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Is it not good for a man that he eat and drink and show himself enjoyment in his toil? This too have I seen that it is from the hand of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">For who will eat and who will hasten [to swallow it] except me?</pasuk><pasuk id="26">For to a man who is good in His sight, He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He has given an occupation to gather and to accumulate, to give to him who is good in God's sight; this too is vanity and frustration.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">Everything has an appointed season, and there is a time for every matter under the heaven.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">A time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot that which is planted.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break and a time to build.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time of wailing and a time of dancing.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">A time to cast stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">A time to seek and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to cast away.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">A time to rend and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">What profit has the one who works in that which he toils?</pasuk><pasuk id="10">I have seen the occupation that God gave to the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">He has made everything beautiful in its time; also the [wisdom of] the world He put into their hearts, save that man should not find the deed which God did, from beginning to end.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">I knew that there is nothing better for them but to rejoice and to do good during his lifetime.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And also, every man who eats and drinks and enjoys what is good in all his toil, it is a gift of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">I knew that everything that God made, that will be forever; we cannot add to it, nor can we subtract from it; and God made it so that they fear Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">That which was is already [done], and that which is [destined] to be, already was, and God seeks the pursued.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And moreover, I saw under the sun, [in] the place of justice, there is wickedness, and [in] the place of righteousness, there is wickedness.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">I said to myself, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every deed there."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">I said to myself, [that this is] because of the children of men, so that God should clarify for them, so that they may see that they are [like] beasts to themselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">For there is a happening for the children of men, and there is a happening for the beasts-and they have one happening-like the death of this one is the death of that one, and all have one spirit, and the superiority of man over beast is nought, for all is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">All go to one place; all came from the dust, and all return to the dust.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Who knows that the spirit of the children of men is that which ascends on high and the spirit of the beast is that which descends below to the earth?</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And I saw that there is nothing better than that man rejoice in his deeds, for that is his portion, for who will bring him to see what will be after him?</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">But I returned and saw all the oppressed who are made [so] under the sun, and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they have no consoler, and from the hand of their oppressors there is power, but they have no consoler.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And I praise the dead who have already died, more than the living who are still alive.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And better than both of them is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And I saw all the toil and all the excellence of work, which is a man's envy of his friend; this too is vanity and frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Better is a handful of ease than two handfuls of toil and frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">There is one, and there is no second; yea, he has neither son nor brother, and there is no end to all his toil; neither is his eye sated from wealth. Now for whom do I toil and deprive my soul of pleasure? This too is vanity and an unhappy affair.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Two are better than one, since they have good reward for their toil.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">For if they fall, one will lift up his friend, but woe to the one who falls and has no second one to lift him up.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Moreover, if two lie down, they will have warmth, but how will one have warmth?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And if a man prevails against the one, the two will stand against him, and a three- stranded cord will not quickly be broken.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Better a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who no longer knows to receive admonition.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">For out of the prison he has come to reign, for even in his kingdom, he becomes humble.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">I saw all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child who will rise in his stead.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">There is no end to all the people, to all that were before them; also the last ones will not rejoice with him, for this too is vanity and frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Watch your feet when you go to the House of God, and be ready to obey rather than fools should give sacrifice, for they know not that they do evil.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">Be not rash with your mouth, and let your heart not be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven, and you are on the earth; therefore, let your words be few.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">For a dream comes with much concern, and the voice of the fool with many words.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">When you pronounce a vow to God, do not delay to pay, for He has no pleasure in fools; that which you vow, pay.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">It is better that you vow not, than that you vow and do not pay it.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Do not allow your mouth to cause sin to your flesh, and say not before the messenger that it is an error; why should God be wroth with your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For despite many dreams and vanities and many words, only fear God.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">If you see oppression of the poor and deprivation of justice and righteousness in the province, wonder not about the matter, for the Highest over the high waits, and there are higher ones over them.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the loftiness of the earth is in everything; even the King is subservient to the field.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Whoever loves silver will not be sated with silver, and he who loves a multitude without increase-this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">With the increase of good, its eaters increase, and what is the advantage to its Master, except seeing [with] His eyes?</pasuk><pasuk id="11">The sleep of the laborer is sweet, whether he eat little or much, but the satiety of the rich does not allow him to sleep.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">There is a grievous evil that I saw under the sun; riches kept by their owner for his harm.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And those riches are lost through an evil design, and he will beget a son who will have nothing in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">As he left his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and he will carry nothing with his toil, that he will take in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And this too is a grievous evil, that just as it came so shall it go, and what advantage does he have that he toil for the wind?</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Also all his days he eats in the dark, and he has much vexation and sickness and wrath.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Behold what I saw; it is good, yea, it is beautiful, to eat and drink and to experience goodness with all his toil that he toils under the sun, the number of the days of his life that God gave him, for that is his portion.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Also every man whom God has given riches and property and has given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice with his toil; that is a gift of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">For let him remember that the days of his life are not many, for God is testimony of the joy of his heart.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is prevalent among men.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">A man whom God gives riches and property and honor, and his soul lacks nothing of all he desires, and God gives him no power to eat of it, but a strange man eats it; this is vanity and a grievous sickness.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Should a man beget one hundred [children] and live many years, and he will have much throughout the days of his years, but his soul will not be sated from all the good, neither did he have burial. I said that the stillborn is better than he.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">For he comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness his name is covered.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Moreover, he did not see the sun nor did he know [it]; this one has more gratification than that one.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And if he had lived a thousand years twice and experienced no pleasure, do not all go to one place?</pasuk><pasuk id="7">All of a person's toil is for his mouth, and is the appetite not yet sated?</pasuk><pasuk id="8">For what is the advantage of the wise over the fool? What [less] has the poor man who knows how to go along with the living?</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Better is what he sees with his eyes than that which goes to sate his appetite; this too is vanity and frustration.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">What was, its name was already called, and it is known that he is a man, and he will not be able to strive with him who is stronger than he.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">For there are many things that increase vanity; what will remain for a man?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For who knows what is good for man in his lifetime, the number of the days of his life of vanity, that he do them like a shadow, for who will tell man what will be after him under the sun?</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">A [good] name is better than good oil, and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for that is the end of every man, and the living shall lay it to his heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Vexation is better than laughter, for with a stern countenance the heart will rejoice.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, whereas the heart of the fools is in a house of joy.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">It is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man than for a man to hear the song of the fools.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For as the sound of the thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool, and this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">For the taunt makes the wise foolish, and it destroys the understanding, which is a gift.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The end of a thing is better than its beginning; better the patient in spirit than the haughty in spirit.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Be not hasty with your spirit to become wroth, for wrath lies in the bosom of fools.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Do not say, "How was it that the former days were better than these?" For not out of wisdom have you asked concerning this.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Wisdom is good with a heritage, and it is a profit to those who see the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For whoever is in the shade of wisdom is in the shade of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its possessor.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">See God's work, for who can straighten out what He made crooked?</pasuk><pasuk id="14">On a day of good, be among the good, and on a day of adversity, ponder; God has made one corresponding to the other, to the end that man will find nothing after Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">I have seen everything in the days of my vanity; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his wickedness.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Be not overly righteous, and be not overly wise; why should you bring desolation upon yourself?</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Be not overly wicked, and be not a fool; why should you die before your time?</pasuk><pasuk id="18">It is good that you should take hold of this, and also from this you shall not withdraw your hand, for he who fears God will discharge himself of them all.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Wisdom affords strength to the wise more than ten rulers who were in the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">For there is no righteous man on earth who does good and sins not.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Also, take no heed of all the words that they speak, lest you hear your servant curse you.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">For your heart knows that many times you too cursed others.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">All this I tested with wisdom; I said, "I will become wise," but it was far from me.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">What was is far off, and [it is] very deep, who can find it?</pasuk><pasuk id="25">I turned about with my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness and madness.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, her hands are bonds; whoever is good in God's sight will escape from her, and a sinner will be taken by her.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">See, this I have found, said Koheleth, adding one to another to find out the account.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Which my soul sought yet, but I did not find; one man out of a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I did not find.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">See, only this one have I found, for God made man straight, but they sought many intrigues.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="8"><pasuk id="1">Who is like the wise man, and who knows the meaning of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the boldness of his face is changed.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">I [am prepared to] observe the commandment of the King, and concerning the oath of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Hasten not to go away from before Him; stay not in an evil thing; for all that He wishes, He will do.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Inasmuch as the King's word is the rule, and who will say to Him, "What are You doing?"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Whoever keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing, and the heart of a wise man knows time and justice.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For every desire has a time and judgment, when the evil of man is great upon him.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">For he knows not what will be, for how it will be, who will tell him?</pasuk><pasuk id="8">No man controls the will [of God's messenger] to retain the spirit, and there is no ruling on the day of death; neither is there discharge in war, nor will wickedness save the one who practices it.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">I saw all this, and I applied my heart to all the work that is done under the sun, a time that a man ruled over [another] man for his [own] harm.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And so I saw the wicked buried, and they came, and from the place of the Holy One they go away, and they will be forgotten in the city that they did so; this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Because the sentence of the deed of evil is not executed swiftly; therefore, the heart of the children of men is encouraged to do evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For a sinner does evil a hundred [years], and He grants him an extension; but I know too that it will be good for those who fear God because they fear Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">But it will not be well with the wicked, and he will not prolong [his] days, like a shadow, because he does not fear God.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">There is vanity that is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deed of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the deed of the righteous; I said that this too is vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And I praised joy, for there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry, and that will accompany him in his toil the days of his life that God gave him under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the conduct that is done upon the earth, for neither by day nor by night does he see sleep with his eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And I saw all the deed of God, for a person will not be able to fathom the deed that is done under the sun, because though a man toils to seek, he will not fathom [it], and even if the wise man claims to know [it], he will be unable to fathom [it].</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="9"><pasuk id="1">For all this I laid to my heart and to clarify all this, that the righteous and the wise and their works are in God's hand; even love, even hate, man does not know; everything is before them.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Everything [comes to them] as [it comes] to all; [there is] one occurrence for the righteous and for the wicked, for the good, and for the pure, and for the unclean, and for he who sacrifices, and for he who does not sacrifice; like the good, so is the sinner; he who swears is like him who fears an oath.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">This is the most evil in all that is done under the sun, that all have one occurrence, and also the heart of the children of men is full of evil, and there is madness in their heart in their lifetime, and after that they go to the dead.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">For whoever is joined to all the living has hope, for concerning a live dog [it is said that] he is better than a dead lion.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for their remembrance is forgotten.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Also their love, as well as their hate, as well as their provocation has already been lost, and they have no more share forever in all that is done under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Go, eat your bread joyfully and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already accepted your deeds.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">At all times, let your garments be white, and let oil not be wanting on your head.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of the life of your vanity, whom He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity, for that is your portion in life and in your toil that you toil under the sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Whatever your hand attains to do [as long as you are] with your strength, do; for there is neither deed nor reckoning, neither knowledge nor wisdom in the grave, where you are going.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">I returned and saw under the sun, that the race does not belong to the swift, nor the war to the mighty; neither do the wise have bread, nor do the understanding have riches, nor the knowledgeable, favor; for time and fate will overtake them all.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For a person does not even know his time, like the fish that are caught with an inferior trap and like the birds that are caught in the snare; like them, the children of men are trapped at a time of evil, when it falls upon them suddenly.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">[There was] a small city, with few people in it, and a great king came upon it and surrounded it and built over it great bulwarks.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And there was found therein a poor wise man, and he extricated the city through his wisdom, but no man remembered that poor man.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And I said, "Wisdom is better than might, but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heard."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The words of the wise are heard [when spoken] softly, more than the shout of a ruler of fools.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Wisdom is better than weapons, and one sinner destroys much good.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="10"><pasuk id="1">Dying flies make putrid and foamy the oil of a perfumer; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The heart of the wise man is at his right, whereas the heart of the fool is at his left.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Also on the road, when a fool walks, his understanding is lacking, and he says to all that he is a fool.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">If the spirit of the Ruler ascends upon you, do not leave your place, for a cure assuages great sins.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">
There is an evil that I saw under the sun, like an error that goes forth from before the ruler.
