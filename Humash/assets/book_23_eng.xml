And I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal, the name of the idolatrous priests with the ancillary priests,</pasuk><pasuk id="5">and those who prostrate themselves on the roofs to the host of the heavens, and those who prostrate themselves who swear by the Lord and swear by their king,</pasuk><pasuk id="6">and those who turn away from following the Lord, and those who did not seek the Lord nor inquire after Him.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Be silent before the Lord God, for the day of the Lord is near. For the Lord has prepared a slaughter; He has invited His guests.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it shall be on the day of the Lord's slaughter, that I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king's sons, and upon all those who wear gentile garb.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I will visit upon everyone who leaps over the threshold [a Philistine idolatrous practice], [and] those who fill the houses of their masters with violence and deceit.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And it shall come to pass on that day, says the Lord; A sound of a cry from the fish gate, and a wail from the second gate, and great destruction from the hills.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Wail, O you inhabitants of Maktesh, for the entire people of Canaan is cut off; all those laden with silver have been cut off.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and I will visit upon the men who are settled on their lees, who say in their heart, "The Lord shall do neither good nor harm."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation, and they shall build houses and not dwell in them, and plant vineyards and not drink their wine.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">The great day of the Lord is near; it is near and hastens greatly, the sound of the day of the Lord, wherein the mighty man cries bitterly.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">That day is a day of wrath; a day of trouble and distress; a day of ruin and desolation; a day of darkness and gloom; a day of clouds and thick darkness;</pasuk><pasuk id="16">a day of shofar and alarm against the fortified cities and against the high towers.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like the blind, for they have sinned against the Lord. And their blood shall be shed like dust, and their flesh like dung.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath. And with the fire of His passion the entire land shall be consumed; for an end, yea, a sudden end, He shall make of all the inhabitants of the land.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">Gather yourselves together! Yea, gather together, O nation that has no desire,</pasuk><pasuk id="2">before the decree is born, as chaff that passes..the sun; before the fierce anger of the Lord comes upon you; before the day of the Lord's anger comes upon you.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth who executed His judgment; Seek righteousness, seek humility! Perhaps you will be concealed on the day of the Lord's wrath.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">For Gaza shall be deserted, and Ashkelon shall become wasteland. Ashdod-At noon they shall drive her out, and Ekron shall be uprooted.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of Cherethites! The word of the Lord is against you, Canaan land of the Philistines, and I will destroy you so that there shall not be an inhabitant.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the seacoast shall be breakfast nooks for shepherds and sheepfolds.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And it shall be a lot for the remnant of the house of Judah, whereupon they shall pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down in the evening, for the Lord their God shall visit upon them and return their captivity.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">I heard the taunts of Moab and the jeers of the children of Ammon, who taunted My people, and they aggrandized themselves on their border.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Therefore, as I live-says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel-for Moab shall be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gemorrah; a rattling of nettles, and a salt mine, and desolation forever. The remnant of My people shall plunder them, and the remnant of My nation shall inherit them.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">They shall have this instead of their haughtiness, for they taunted and aggrandized themselves over the people of the Lord of Hosts.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">The Lord shall be feared by them, for He weakened all the gods of the earth. And every man shall prostrate himself to Him from his place, all the isles of the nations.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">You, too, Cushites-they are the slain of My sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And He shall incline His hand on the north, and destroy Assyria and make Nineveh desolate wasteland like the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And flocks shall lie down in its midst, all the beasts of the nations.

She did not trust in the Lord. She did not draw near to her God.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Her princes in her midst are roaring lions; her judges, wolves of the evening. They did not leave over the bones for morning.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Her prophets are unstable, treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary; they have removed the Torah.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The Lord is just in her midst; He commits no injustice. Every morning He brings His judgment to light. It does not fail. But the one who commits injustice knows no shame.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">I have cut off nations; their towers have become desolate. I have destroyed their streets so that no one passes by. Their cities have become waste so that there is no man-so that there is no inhabitant.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">I said, "Surely you will fear Me, you will accept reproof, and her dwelling shall not be cut off, all that I ordained upon her." But they arose early and corrupted all their deeds.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Therefore, wait for Me, says the Lord, for the day that I will rise up to meet [with you]. For it is My judgment to assemble nations, to gather kingdoms, to pour out My fury upon them; yea, all the kindling of My wrath, for with the fire of My jealousy all the earth shall be consumed.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For then I will convert the peoples to a pure language that all of them call in the name of the Lord, to worship Him of one accord.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">From the other side of the rivers of Cush, My supplicants, the community of My scattered ones-they shall bring Me an offering.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">On that day you shall not be ashamed of all your deeds [with] which you rebelled against Me, for then I will remove from your midst those who rejoice in your pride, and you shall no longer continue to be haughty on My holy mount.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And I will leave over in your midst a humble and poor people, and they shall take shelter in the name of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">The remnant of Israel shall neither commit injustice nor speak lies; neither shall deceitful speech be found in their mouth, for they shall graze and lie down, with no one to cause them to shudder.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Sing, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O Israel! Rejoice and jubilate wholeheartedly, O daughter of Jerusalem!</pasuk><pasuk id="15">The Lord has removed your afflictions; He has cast out your enemy. The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst-you shall no longer fear evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, "Have no fear! O Zion, let your hands not be slack.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The Lord your God is in your midst-a Mighty One Who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will be silent in His love. He will jubilate over you with song."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Those who are removed from the appointed season I have destroyed. They were of you-it was a burden of shame upon her.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Behold, I wreak destruction upon all those who afflict you at that time. And I will save the one who limps, and I will gather the stray one, and I will make them a praise and a name throughout all the land where they suffered shame.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">At that time I will bring them, and at [that] time I will gather you, for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your captivities before your eyes, said the Lord.</pasuk></chapter></book>
