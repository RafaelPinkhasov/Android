<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, which he prophesied concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Hear, all you peoples; hearken, O land and the fullness thereof, and let the Lord God be a witness against you; the Lord from His Holy Temple.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">For behold, the Lord comes forth from His place, and He shall descend and tread upon the high places of the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the mountains shall melt under Him, and the valleys shall split-as wax before fire, as water poured down a steep place.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">All this is because of the transgression of Jacob, and because of the sins of the house of Israel. Who is [the cause of] the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And who [is the cause of] the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And I will make Samaria into a heap in the field, into a place for planting vineyards; and I will cast its stones down into the valley, and its foundations I will uncover.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And all its graven images shall be crushed, and all its hires shall be burnt with fire, and all its idols I will lay waste; for from the hire of a harlot it gathered, and to the hire of a harlot shall they return.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Concerning this I will lament and wail; I will go mad and be naked; I will make a wailing as jackals, and mourning as ostriches.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For she is mortally ill [from] her wounds, for it has come up to Judah; it has reached the gate of My people up to Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Do not declare it in Gath, do not weep; in the houses of Aphrah, wallow in the dust.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Pass along your way, you inhabitant of Shafir, with your private parts exposed; the inhabitants of Zaanan did not go forth; the lamentation caused by drawing the houses one to the other shall take its stand from you.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For the one dwelling in disobedience hoped for good, but evil descended from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Hitch the chariot to the swift steeds, you inhabitant of Lachish; it is the beginning of sin for the daughter of Zion, for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Since you give expulsions to the dynasty that gave you the possession of Gath, the houses of Achzib shall be a dried up spring for the kings of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">I will yet bring the possessor to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah; up to Adullam shall the glory of Israel come.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Make [your head] bald and crop [your hair] for the children of your delight; widen your bald spot [to be] like an eagle-for they have been exiled from you.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">Woe to those who plot iniquity and work evil in their beds; when the morning becomes light they perform it, for their hand has the power.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And they covet fields, and they rob; and houses, and they take; and they oppress a man and his house, and a man and his heritage.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Therefore, so said the Lord: Behold! I plot evil against this family, from which you shall not remove your necks, nor shall you walk erect, for it is a time of evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">On that day he shall take up a parable against you, and he shall lament, "A lamentation has come about"; and he shall say, "They have robbed us! He changes the portion of my people! How will He turn to me to return our fields, which he divides?"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Therefore, you shall not have anyone who casts a line by lot in the congregation of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">"Preach not, those who preach; they shall not preach to these; [then] they shall not take shame."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Is that what is said by the house of Jacob? Has the Lord's patience grown short? Are these His deeds? Do my words not benefit the one who goes straight?</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the matter for which My people causes [Me] to rise as an enemy, because of the garment and the mantle that you strip from those who pass by confidently, who return from the war.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">The wives of My people you drive away from the house of her delights, from her infants-you take away My glory forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Arise and go, for this is not the tranquility; in order to contaminate it, it forms bands, and the band is clarified.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">If a man walking in wind and falsehood lies, "I will preach to you of wine and strong drink," he shall be a preacher for this people.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; together I will make them as sheep in a fold, as a flock within its stall shall they stir with people.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">The breaker has gone up before them; they broke and passed through a gate and went out through it; and their king passed before them, and the Lord was at their head.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">And I said: Hearken now, you heads of Jacob and officers of the house of Israel! Is it not incumbent upon you to know the judgment?</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Those who hate good and love evil-who rob their skin from upon them and their flesh from upon their bones,</pasuk><pasuk id="3">and who ate the flesh of My people and flayed their skin from upon them, and opened their bones and broke them, as in a pot, and like meat within a cauldron</pasuk><pasuk id="4">then they shall cry out to the Lord, but He shall not respond to them; and He shall hide His countenance from them at that time, as they wrought evil with their works.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">So said the Lord concerning the prophets who mislead my people, who bite with their teeth and herald peace, but concerning whomever does not give into their mouth, they prepare war.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Therefore, it shall be night for you because of the vision, and it shall be dark for you because of the divination, and the sun shall set on the prophets, and the day shall be darkened about them.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners shall be disgraced, and they shall all cover their upper lips, for it is not a statement of God.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">But I am truly full of strength from the spirit of the Lord and justice and might, to tell Jacob his transgression and Israel his sin.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Hearken now to this, you heads of the house of Jacob and you rulers of the house of Israel, who condemn justice and pervert all that is straight.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Each one builds Zion with blood and Jerusalem with injustice.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Its heads judge for bribes, and its priests teach for a price; and its prophets divine for money, and they rely on the Lord, saying, "Is not the Lord in our midst? No evil shall befall us."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the Temple Mount like the high places of a forest.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And it shall be at the end of the days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be firmly established at the top of the mountains, and it shall be raised above the hills, and peoples shall stream upon it.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And many nations shall go, and they shall say, "Come, let us go up to the Lord's mount and to the house of the God of Jacob, and let Him teach us of His ways, and we will go in His paths," for out of Zion shall the Torah come forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And he shall judge between many peoples and reprove mighty nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nations shall not lift the sword against nation; neither shall they learn war anymore.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they shall dwell each man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them move, for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts has spoken.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">For all peoples shall go, each one in the name of his god, but we will go in the name of the Lord, our God, forever and ever.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">On that day, says the Lord: I will heal the limping one, and the lost one I will gather, and those whom I harmed.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I will make the limping one into a remnant, and the scattered one into a mighty nation, and the Lord shall reign over them on Mount Zion from now and forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And you-tower of the flock, the tower of the daughter of Zion-to you it shall come; yea, the former kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Now, why do you seek friends? Is the King not among you? Has your Counsellor perished, that pangs have seized you like a woman in confinement?</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Be in pain and kneel, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in confinement, for now you shall go forth from the city; and you shall dwell in the field, and you shall come up to Babylon; there you shall be saved; there the Lord shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And now, many nations shall gather upon you who say, "Let her be guilty, and our eyes shall gaze on Zion."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">But they did not know the thoughts of the Lord; neither did they understand His counsel, for He gathered them as sheaves to a threshing floor.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves copper; and you shall crush many nations, and you shall devote their plunder to the Lord, and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Now you shall gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops; he has laid seige to us. With a rod they strike the judges of Israel on the cheek.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah-you should have been the lowest of the clans of Judah-from you [he] shall emerge for Me, to be a ruler over Israel; and his origin is from of old, from days of yore.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Therefore, He shall deliver them until the time a woman in confinement gives birth. And the rest of his brothers shall return upon the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And he shall stand and lead with the might of the Lord, with the pride of the Lord, his God: and they shall return, for now he shall become great to the ends of the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And this shall be peace. Should Assyria come into our land, and should they tread upon our palaces, we will appoint over them seven shepherds and eight princes of men.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they shall break the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its gates; and he shall save [us] from Assyria, who comes into our land, and who treads in our border.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples-like dew sent by the Lord, like torrents of rain upon vegatation that does not hope for any man and does not wait for the sons of men.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples-like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, which, if it passes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and no one [can] save anything.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Your hand shall be raised above your oppressors, and all your enemies shall be destroyed.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it shall come to pass on that day, says the Lord, that I will cut your horses out of your midst, and I will destroy your chariots.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And I will destroy the cities of your land, and I will break down all your fortresses.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And I will destroy sorcery from your hand, and you will have no soothsayers.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And I will destroy your graven images and your monuments from your midst, and you shall no longer prostrate yourself to your handiwork.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And I will uproot your asherim from your midst, and I will destroy your enemies.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And in anger and fury I will execute vengeance upon the nations who have paid no heed.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">Hear now what the Lord says; Rise; contend with the mountains, and may the hills hear My voice.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Hear ye, O mountains, the controversy of the Lord; and you mighty ones, the foundations of the earth; for the Lord has a controversy with His people, and with Israel He shall contend.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">O My people, what have I done, and how have I wearied you? Testify against Me.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab planned, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him. From Shittim to Gilgal, may you recognize the righteous deeds of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">With what shall I come before the Lord, bow before the Most High God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves?</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with myriad streams of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</pasuk><pasuk id="8">He has told you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord demands of you; but to do justice, to love loving-kindness, and to walk discreetly with your God.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">The voice of the Lord calls out to the city, and the wisdom of the Torah, the one who sees Your name; hearken to the staff and Who appointed it.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Does the house of the wicked last long, [or do] the treasures of wickedness? And an ephah of leanness is condemned.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Will I merit with scales of wickedness or with a bag of deceitful weights?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For the wealthy thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof speak lies, and their tongue is guile in their mouth.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Therefore I, too, will smite you with sore wounds and make [you] desolate because of your sins.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">You shall eat and not be sated, and it shall bend you over in your innards; and you shall overtake, but you shall not rescue, and those whom you rescue I will deliver to the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint yourself with oil; and the must; but you shall not drink wine.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the statutes of Omri shall be observed, and every deed of the house of Ahab; and you shall walk in their counsels, in order that I make you an astonishment, and its inhabitants a hissing; and the disgrace of My people you shall bear.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">Woe is to me, for I am as the last of the figs, like the gleanings of the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; the first ripe fig my soul desires.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The pious have perished from the land, and there is no upright among men; they all lurk for blood; each one hunts his brother with a net.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">[In return] for the evil of their hands, do they expect that He will benefit them? The prince asks, and the judge is in the payment, and the great man speaks what is in his heart-and they weave the web.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The best of them is like a brier, the most upright, [worse] than a thorn hedge. The day to which you look forward-your visitation-shall come; now will be their perplexity.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Believe not a friend; trust not a prince; from her who lies in your bosom guard the openings of your mouth.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For a son disgraces his father; a daughter rises up against her mother; a daughter-in-law, against her mother- in-law; a man's enemies are the members of his household.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">But I will hope in the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God shall hearken to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Rejoice not against me, my enemy; although I have fallen, I will rise; although I will sit in darkness, the Lord is a light to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">I will bear the fury of the Lord-for I have sinned against Him-until He pleads my cause and executes justice for me. He shall take me out into the light; I will see His righteousness.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And my enemy shall see, and shame shall cover her who says to me, "Where is the Lord your God?" My eyes shall gaze upon her: now she shall become trodden as the mire of the streets.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">"The day to build your walls-that day-its time is way off."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">It is a day, and he shall come up to you: those from Assyria and the fortified cities, and from the fortress up to the river and the sea from the west, and the dwellers of the mountain.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the land shall become desolate [together] with its inhabitants because of the fruit of their deeds.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Lead Your people with Your rod-the flock of Your inheritance who dwell alone, a forest in the midst of a fruitful field-and they shall graze in Bashan and Gilead as in days of yore.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">As in the days of your exodus from the land of Egypt, I will show him wonders.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might-they shall place a hand upon their mouth; their ears shall become deaf.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">They shall lick the dust as a snake, as those who crawl on the earth. They shall quake from their imprisonment; they shall fear the Lord, our God, and they shall fear you.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Who is a God like You, Who forgives iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for He desires loving-kindness.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">He shall return and grant us compassion; He shall hide our iniquities, and You shall cast into the depths of the sea all their sins.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">You shall give the truth of Jacob, the loving-kindness of Abraham, which You swore to our forefathers from days of yore.</pasuk></chapter></book>
