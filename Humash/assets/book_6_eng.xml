<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">And it was after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Moses my servant has died; and now arise cross this Jordan, you and all this nation, to the land which I give the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Every place on which the soles of your feet will tread I have given to you, as I have spoken to Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">From this desert and Lebanon to the great river, the Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the great sea westward shall be your boundary.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">No man shall stand up before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so shall I be with you. I will not weaken My grasp on you nor will I abandon you.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Be strong and have courage; for you will cause this nation to inherit the land that I have sworn to their ancestors to give to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Just be strong and very courageous to observe and do in accordance with all of the Torah that Moses My servant has commanded you. Do not stray therefrom right or left, in order that you succeed wherever you go.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">This book of the Torah shall not leave your mouth; you shall meditate therein day and night, in order that you observe to do all that is written in it, for then will you succeed in all your ways and then will you prosper.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Did I not command you, be strong and have courage, do not fear and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Joshua commanded the officers of the nation, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Go through the midst of the camp and command the nation saying: Prepare provision for yourselves, for in another three days you will cross this Jordan to come and inherit the land that the Lord your God is giving you to inherit.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Remember the word that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you saying: The Lord your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Your wives, your children, and your cattle shall settle in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, and you, all the warriors, shall cross over armed before your brothers, and you shall help them.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Until the Lord gives your brothers rest as He has given you, and they too shall inherit the land that the Lord your God gives them. You will then return to the land of your inheritance which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on this side of the Jordan towards the rising of the sun, and you will inherit it.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And they answered Joshua saying: All that you have commanded us we shall do and wherever you send us we shall go.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Just as we obeyed Moses in everything, so shall we obey you. Only that the Lord your God be with you as He was with Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Every man that shall rebel against your words and will not listen to your commands in all that you order him shall be put to death. Only be strong and have courage.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men out of Shittim to spy secretly, saying, Go see the land and Jericho. And they went, and came to the house of an innkeeper named Rahab, and they lay there.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And it was told to the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come here this night from the children of Israel to search the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who have come to you, that have entered your house, for they have come to search out the entire land.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Now the woman had taken the two men, and had hidden them, and she said, Indeed the men came to me, but I did not know from where they were.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And it was time to close the gate, at darkness, that the men went out. I do not know where they went. Pursue after them quickly, for you will overtake them.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And she had brought them up to the roof, and she hid them with the stalks of flax, that she had laid arranged upon the roof.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the men pursued them in the direction of the Jordan, to the fords; and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, they shut the gate.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And before they were asleep, she came up to them upon the roof.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And she said to the men, I know that the Lord has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away because of you.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you completely destroyed.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And as soon as we heard, our hearts melted, nor did there remain anymore spirit in any man because of you, for the Lord your God He is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And now, I pray, swear to me by the Lord, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And you shall preserve alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers and my sisters, and all that they have, and you shall deliver our lives from death.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if you will not tell this our discussion. And it shall be, when the Lord gives us the land, that we will deal with you with kindness and truth.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was in the town wall and she dwelt in the wall.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And she said to them, Go to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterwards you will go your way.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the men said to her, we will be blameless of this your oath which you made us swear;</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Behold when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which you let us down; and you shall bring your father and your mother, and your brothers and all your father's household home to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of your house outside, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be blameless, and that whosoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be upon our head if any hand be upon him.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And if you tell this our discussion, then we will be blameless of your oath which you have made us swear.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but they did not find them.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the two men returned and descended from the mountain, and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had happened to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they said to Joshua, -For the Lord has delivered into our hands all the land; and also the inhabitants of the country have melted away because of us.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they moved from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel; and they lodged before they crossed over.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And it was at the end of three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And they commanded the people, saying: When you see the Ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place and go after it.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">But there shall be a distance between you and it, just two thousand cubits by measure; do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you will go; for you have not passed this way before.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Joshua said to the people; Prepare yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Joshua said to the priests, saying: Carry the Ark of the covenant, and pass before the people. And they carried the Ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the Lord said to Joshua: This day I will begin to make you great in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I be with you.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And you shall command the priests that bear the Ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the Lord your God.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living God is in your midst, and He will certainly drive out the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites from before you.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Behold, the Ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing ahead of you in the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And now take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, a man for every tribe.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And it shall be, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord, Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from above, shall stand in one heap.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And it was, when the people moved from their tents, to cross the Jordan, and the priests bearing the Ark of the covenant were before the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And when the bearers of the Ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the Ark were dipped in the edge of the water, and the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in one column, very far from Adam, the city which is beside Zarethan; and those that descended to the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea (Dead Sea), were completely cut off, and the people passed over opposite Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the priests that bore the Ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm arranged on the dry land in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completely passed over the Jordan.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And it was when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Take to yourselves twelve men from the people, a man from every tribe.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And command them saying, Take to yourselves from here out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and you shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where you shall lodge this night.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, a man from every tribe.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Joshua said to them, Pass before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and lift up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, What are these stones for you?</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Then you shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them there.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the Ark of the covenant stood; and they have been there to this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the priests that bore the Ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it was, when all the people had completely passed over, that the Ark of the Lord passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">About forty thousand armed for war passed over before the Lord to battle, to the plains of Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">On that day the Lord made Joshua great in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the Lord said to Joshua, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Command the priests that bear the Ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And it was, when the priests that bore the Ark of the covenant of the Lord came up out of the midst of the Jordan, that as soon as the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry land, the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as before.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And these twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What are these stones?</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Then, you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until you passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up from before us, until we passed over.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">That all the people of the earth might know the power of the Lord, that it is mighty; that you might fear the Lord your God forever.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were on the side of the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until they had passed over, that their heart melted, nor was there spirit in them anymore, because of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">At that time the Lord said to Joshua, Make for yourself sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Joshua made for himself sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And this is the reason why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, all the men of war, had died in the desert by the way after they came out of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">For all the people that came out were circumcised, but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the people, the men of war, that came out of Egypt, were consumed, those who did not listen to the voice of the Lord, to whom the Lord had sworn that He would not show them the land, which the Lord had sworn to their forefathers that He would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they had not circumcised them by the way.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it was, when all the people were finished being circumcised, that they remained in their places in the camp, until they recovered.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the Lord said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. And he called the name of the place Gilgal to this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and they made the Passover sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And they ate of the grain of the land on the morrow of the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain on this very day.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the manna ceased on the morrow when they ate of the grain of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna anymore; and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan that year.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And it was when Joshua was in Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and saw, and, behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he said, No, but I am the captain of the host of the Lord; I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and prostrated himself, and said to him, What does my lord say to his servant?</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, Remove your shoe from your foot; for the place upon which you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And Jericho had shut its gates and was barred because of the children of Israel; none went out and none came in.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho and its king, the mighty warriors.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And you shall circle the city, all the men of war, go round about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark; and on the seventh day you shall encircle the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And it shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down in its place and the people shall go up, every man opposite him.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the Ark of the Covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And he said to the people, Pass on, and encircle the city, and let the armed ones pass before the Ark of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it was when Joshua spoke to the people, and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before (the Ark of) the Lord and blew with the trumpets; and the Ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the Ark, (the priests) going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Joshua commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then you shall shout.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And he caused the Ark of the Lord to circle the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the Ark of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark of the Lord were going continuously, and they blew with the trumpets; and the armed men went before them; and the rear guard came after the Ark of the Lord, (the priests) going on and blowing with the trumpets.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the second day they circled the city once, and returned to the camp; so they did six days.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And it was on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning (of the day), and they circled the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they circled the city seven times.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And it was at the seventh time, the priests blew with the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the city shall be devoted; it, and all that is in it, to the Lord; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that is with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And only you keep (yourselves) from the devoted thing, lest you make yourselves condemned when you take of the devoted thing, and make the camp of Israel a ruin, and trouble it.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And all the silver and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, are consecrated to the Lord; they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the people shouted, and (the priests) blew with the trumpets; and it was when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down in its place and the people went up into the city, every man opposite him, and they took the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And they completely destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And to the two men who had spied out the country, Joshua said, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had; and they brought out all her families, and placed them outside the camp of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of copper and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day; because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that rises up and builds this city, Jericho; with (the loss of) his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and with (the loss of) his youngest son shall he set up its gates.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">So the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was throughout the entire land.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">And the children of Israel committed a trespass in the consecrated thing, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the consecrated thing; and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And Joshua sent men from Jericho, to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Do not let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not trouble all the people there; for they are but few.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">So there went up there of the people, about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men; and they chased them from before the gate to Shebarim, and smote them in the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Joshua rent his clothing and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their heads.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Joshua said, Woe, O Lord God, why have You at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? Would that we had been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Pray, oh Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies?</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear and shall encircle us and cut off our name from the earth; and what will You do for Your great Name?</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the Lord said to Joshua, Get up; why do you fall upon your face?</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; and they have also taken of the consecrated thing, and have also stolen, and also dissembled, and they have also put into their vessels.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the children of Israel shall not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore, if you do not destroy the consecrated thing from among you.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Arise, prepare the people, and say, Prepare yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in your midst, O Israel; you will not be able to stand before your enemies, until you remove the accursed thing from among you.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">In the morning, therefore, you shall be brought near according to your tribes; and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord takes shall come near by families; and the family which the Lord takes shall come near by households; and the household which the Lord takes shall come near man by man.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And it shall be, he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, because he has wrought an infamous deed in Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he brought near the family of Judah; and He took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites near man by man; and Zabdi was taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he brought his household near man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the Lord, God of Israel, and make confession to Him; and tell me now what you have done; do not hide anything from me.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus have I done.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and behold, it was hidden in his tent, and the silver under it.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his flock, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? The Lord shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, [after] they [had] stoned them with stones.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore, the name of that place was called, The Valley of Achor, to this day.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="8"><pasuk id="1">And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, and be not dismayed; take all the people of war with you and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And you shall do to Ai and its king, as you did to Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as spoils to yourselves. Set yourself ambush for the city behind it.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he commanded them, saying, Behold you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; do not go very far from the city, and all of you be ready.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And I, and all the people that are with me, will draw near to the city; and it shall be when they come out against us, as at first, that we will flee before them.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And they will come out after us until we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at first. And we will flee before them.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And you shall rise up from the ambush, and drive out (those remaining in) the city; and the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And it shall be, when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the Lord shall you do. See, I have commanded you.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Joshua sent them; and they went to the place of ambush, and stayed between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai; and Joshua lodged that night among the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and counted the people, and he and the elders of Israel went up before the people to Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And all the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and camped on the north side of Ai; and the valley was between him and Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the people set all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city. And Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And it was when the king of Ai saw, they hastened and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them, and fled by way of the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them; and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that did not go out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand, toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that was in his hand, toward the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it, and hastened and set the city on fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the men of Ai looked behind them, and saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the desert, turned back upon the pursuers.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended. Then they turned back and slew the men of Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the others came out of the city against them, so that they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the king of Ai they seized alive, and brought him to Joshua.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And it was when Israel made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the desert where they chased. them, and when they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and smote it with the edge of the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Joshua did not draw back his hand that he had stretched out with the spear, until he had completely destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Only the cattle and the spoils of that city, Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the Lord which He had commanded Joshua.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And the king of Ai he hanged on a gallows until evening, and as the sun set, Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the gallows, and they threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised upon it a great heap of stones to this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel on Mount Ebal.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">As Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, upon which no (man) has lifted up any iron. And they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace-offerings.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And all Israel, and their elders and officers and their judges, stood on this side of the Ark and on that side, before the priests the Levites, the bearers of the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, the stranger as well as the native born, half of them over against Mount Gerizim and half of them over against Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, to bless the people of Israel first.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the Torah.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that walked among them.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="9"><pasuk id="1">And it was when all the kings that were on this side of the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the valley, and on all of the shore of the great sea opposite Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard (of this),</pasuk><pasuk id="2">That they gathered together to war with Joshua and with Israel, with a single accord.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they also acted with wile, and they went, and disguised as ambassadors, and they took worn sacks for their donkeys, and wine bottles, rotten, split, and tied together.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And worn, patched shoes on their feet, and worn garments upon them, and all the bread of their provisions was dry and mouldy.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel: "We have come from a distant land, and now make a covenant with us."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And each of the men of Israel said to the Hivites: "Perhaps you dwell in my midst, and how can I make a covenant with you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they said to Joshua: "We are your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who are you and from where do you come?"</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And they said to him, "From a very distant land have your servants come, because of the Name of the Lord your God, for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go towards them, and say to them, 'We are your servants; and now make a covenant with us.'</pasuk><pasuk id="12">This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we set out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become mouldy.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And these wine-skins which we filled, were new; and, behold they are split. And these our garments and our shoes are worn because of the very long journey.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the men took of their provision, and did not ask counsel of the mouth of the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live; and the princes of the congregation swore to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And it was at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. And their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And the children of Israel did not smite them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the princes.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And all the Princes said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel; now, therefore, we may not touch them.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">This we will do to them, and let them live; and there will be no wrath upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the princes said to them, "Let them live.." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us?</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And now you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be slaves from you, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they answered Joshua, and said, "Because it was certainly told to your servants how the Lord your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; and we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And now, behold, we are in your hand. As it seems good and right to you to do to us, do."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And he did so to them, and he delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord, to this day, in the place which He would choose.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="10"><pasuk id="1">And it came to pass, when Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had taken Ai, and had completely destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so had he done to Ai and her king; and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</pasuk><pasuk id="2">That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all her men were mighty.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="4">"Come up to me and help me, and we will smite Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their camps, and encamped on Gibeon, and made war against it.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, "Do not slack your hands from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And Joshua came to them suddenly; he had gone up from Gilgal all night.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the Lord confused them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and they chased them by the way that goes up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And it was as they fled from before Israel, and were in the descent of Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died with the hailstones than whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still upon Gibeon, and Moon in the valley of Ajalon."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the book of Jashar? (which is the Torah)? So the sun stood still in the midst of the heaven, and it did not hasten to go down exactly a whole day.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Joshua was told, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Joshua said, "Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and appoint men by it to guard them.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And don't you stay; pursue your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them. Do not let them enter their cities, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And it was when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered the fortified cities.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua to Makkedah in peace; none whetted his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And they did so, and they brought forth those five kings to him from the cave; the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And it was when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon their necks.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage, for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five poles; and they were hanging upon the poles until the evening.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And it was at the time of the setting of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the poles, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hidden, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave until this very day.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And on that day, Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king he utterly destroyed, them and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Joshua passed on from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and he fought against Libnah.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And the Lord delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people until he left him none remaining.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And from Lachish Joshua passed on to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it he completely destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword and its king and all its cities, and all the souls that were in it; and he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but destroyed it completely and all the souls that were in it.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and he fought against it.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And he took it and its king, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and completely destroyed all the souls that were in it; he left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and to its king, as he had done also to Libnah and to her king.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And Joshua smote all the country (of) the hills and of the south, and of the valley, and of the falls, and all their kings.
