One statute shall apply to you, to the proselyte and to the native-born citizen.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">On the day the Mishkan was erected, the cloud covered the Mishkan, which was a tent for the Testimony, and at evening, there was over the Mishkan like an appearance of fire, [which remained] until morning.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">So it was always, the cloud covered it and there was an appearance of fire at night.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">and according to the cloud's departure from over the Tent, and afterwards, the children of Israel would travel, and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would encamp.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">At the bidding of the Lord, the children of Israel traveled, and at the bidding of the Lord, they encamped. As long as the cloud hovered above the Mishkan, they encamped.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">When the cloud lingered over the Mishkan for many days, the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord and did not travel.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">Sometimes, the cloud remained for several days above the Mishkan; at the Lord's bidding they traveled and at the Lord's bidding they encamped.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, and when the cloud departed in the morning, they traveled. Or, the cloud remained for a day and a night, and when the cloud departed, they traveled.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Whether it was for two days, a month or a year, that the cloud lingered to hover over the Mishkan, the children of Israel would encamp and not travel, and when it departed, they traveled.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">At the Lord's bidding they would encamp, and at the Lord's bidding they would travel; they kept the charge of the Lord by the word of the Lord through Moses.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="10"><pasuk id="1">The Lord spoke to Moses saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Make yourself two silver trumpets; you shall make them [from a] beaten [form]; they shall be used by you to summon the congregation and to announce the departure of the camps.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">When they blow on them, the entire congregation shall assemble to you, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">If they blow one of them, the princes, the leaders of Israel's thousands, shall convene to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">When you blow a teruah [a series of short blasts, the camps which are encamped to the east shall travel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">When you blow a second teruah, the camps encamped to the south shall travel; they shall blow a teruah for traveling.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">But when assembling the congregation, you shall blow a tekiah [long blast] but not a teruah.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The descendants of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; this shall be an eternal statute for your generations.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">If you go to war in your land against an adversary that oppresses you, you shall blow a teruah with the trumpets and be remembered before the Lord your God, and thus be saved from your enemies.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals and on your new-moon celebrations, you shall blow on the trumpets for your ascent-offerings and your peace sacrifices, and it shall be a remembrance before your God; I am the Lord your God.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">On the twentieth of the second month in the second year, the cloud rose up from over the Tabernacle of the Testimony.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">The children of Israel traveled on their journeys from the Sinai desert, and the cloud settled in the desert of Paran.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">This was the first journey at God's bidding through Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">The banner of the camp of Judah's children traveled first according to their legions. Heading the legion was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Heading the legion of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Heading the legion of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">The Tabernacle was dismantled, and the sons of Gershon set out, [together] with the sons of Merari who carried the Tabernacle.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Then the banner of the camp of Reuben set out according to their legions.

Heading its legion was Elishama the son of Amihud.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Heading the legion of the tribe of the children of Menasseh was Gamliel the son of Pedahzur.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Heading the legion of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gidoni.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Then the banner of the camp of Dan set out, the collector for all the other camps, according to its legions. Heading its legion was Achiezer the son of Amishaddai.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Heading the legion of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Heading the legion of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enon.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">These are the travels of the children of Israel according to their legions, and then they traveled.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses's father-in-law, We are traveling to the place about which the Lord said, I will give it to you. Come with us and we will be good to you, for the Lord has spoken of good fortune for Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">He said to him, I won't go, for I will go to my land and my birthplace.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">He said, Please don't leave us, for because you are familiar with our encampments in the desert and you will be our guide.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And if you go with us, then we will bestow on you the good which God grants us.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">They traveled a distance of three days from the mountain of the Lord, and the Ark of the Lord's covenant traveled three days ahead of them to seek for them a place to settle.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">The cloud of the Lord was above them by day, when they traveled from the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">So it was, whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, Arise, O Lord, may Your enemies be scattered and may those who hate You flee from You.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And when it came to rest he would say, Repose O Lord, among the myriads of thousands of Israel.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="11"><pasuk id="1">The people were looking to complain, and it was evil in the ears of the Lord. The Lord heard and His anger flared, and a fire from the Lord burned among them, consuming the extremes of the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">The people cried out to Moses; Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire died down.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">He named that place Tab'erah, for the fire of the Lord had burned among them there.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">But the multitude among them began to have strong cravings. Then even the children of Israel once again began to cry, and they said, "Who will feed us meat?</pasuk><pasuk id="5">We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt free of charge, the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">But now, our bodies are dried out, for there is nothing at all; we have nothing but manna to look at."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance was like the appearance of crystal.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The people walked about and gathered it. Then they ground it in a mill or crushed it in a mortar, cooked it in a pot and made it into cakes. It had a taste like the taste of oil cake.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">When the dew descended on the camp at night, the manna would descend upon it.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Moses heard the people weeping with their families,each one at the entrance to his tent. The Lord became very angry, and Moses considered it evil.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Moses said to the Lord, "Why have You treated Your servant so badly? Why have I not found favor in Your eyes that You place the burden of this entire people upon me?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Did I conceive this entire people? Did I give birth to them, that You say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom as the nurse carries the suckling,' to the Land You promised their forefathers?</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Where can I get meat to give all these people? For they are crying on me, saying, 'Give us meat to eat.'</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Alone I cannot carry this entire people for it is too hard for me.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">If this is the way You treat me, please kill me if I have found favor in Your eyes, so that I not see my misfortune."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then the Lord said to Moses, "Assemble for Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the people's elders and officers, and you shall take them to the Tent of Meeting, and they shall stand there with You.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">I will come down and speak with you there, and I will increase the spirit that is upon you and bestow it upon them. Then they will bear the burden of the people with you so that you need not bear it alone.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And to the people, you shall say, 'Prepare yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat, because you have cried in the ears of the Lord saying, "Who will feed us meat, for we had it better in Egypt." [Therefore,] the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">You shall eat it not one day, not two days, not five days, not ten days, and not twenty days.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">But even for a full month until it comes out your nose and nauseates you. Because you have despised the Lord Who is among you, and you cried before Him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Moses said, "Six hundred thousand people on foot are the people in whose midst I am, and You say, 'I will give them meat, and they will eat it for a full month'?</pasuk><pasuk id="22">If sheep and cattle were slaughtered for them, would it suffice for them? If all the fish of the sea were gathered for them, would it suffice for them?"</pasuk><pasuk id="23">Then the Lord said to Moses, "Is My power limited? Now you will see if My word comes true for you or not!"</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said, and he assembled seventy men of the elders of the people, and stood them around the Tent.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">The Lord descended in a cloud and spoke to him, and He increased some of the spirit that was on him and bestowed it on the seventy elders. And when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not continue.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Now two men remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the second was Medad, and the spirit rested upon them. They were among those written, but they did not go out to the tent, but prophesied in the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">The lad ran and told Moses, saying, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant from his youth, answered and said, Moses, my master, imprison them!"</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Moses said to him, "Are you zealous for my sake? If only all the Lord's people were prophets, that the Lord would bestow His spirit upon them!"</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Then Moses entered the camp; he and the elders of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">A wind went forth from the Lord and swept quails from the sea and spread them over the camp about one day's journey this way and one day's journey that way, around the camp, about two cubits above the ground.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">The people rose up all that day and all night and the next day and gathered the quails. [Even] the one who gathered the least collected ten heaps. They spread them around the camp in piles.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">The meat was still between their teeth; it was not yet finished, and the anger of the Lord flared against the people, and the Lord struck the people with a very mighty blow.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">He named that place Kivroth Hata'avah [Graves of Craving], for there they buried the people who craved.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">From Kivroth Hata'avah the people traveled to Hazeroth, and they stayed in Hazeroth.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="12"><pasuk id="1">Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses regarding the Cushite woman he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">They said, "Has the Lord spoken only to Moses? Hasn't He spoken to us too?" And the Lord heard.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Now this man Moses was exceedingly humble, more so than any person on the face of the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The Lord suddenly said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Go out, all three of you, to the Tent of Meeting!" And all three went out.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The Lord descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent. He called to Aaron and Miriam, and they both went out.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">He said, "Please listen to My words. If there be prophets among you, [I] the Lord will make Myself known to him in a vision; I will speak to him in a dream.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Not so is My servant Moses; he is faithful throughout My house.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">With him I speak mouth to mouth; in a vision and not in riddles, and he beholds the image of the Lord. So why were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses ?</pasuk><pasuk id="9">The wrath of the Lord flared against them and He left.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The cloud departed from above the Tent, and behold, Miriam was afflicted with tzara'ath, [as white] as snow. Then Aaron turned to Miriam and behold, she was afflicted with tzara'ath.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Aaron said to Moses, "Please, master, do not put sin upon us for acting foolishly and for sinning.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Let her not be like the dead, which comes out of his mother's womb with half his flesh consumed!"</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, "I beseech you, God, please heal her."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">The Lord replied to Moses, "If her father were to spit in her face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? She shall be confined for seven days outside the camp, and afterwards she may enter.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not travel until Miriam had entered.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Then the people departed from Hazeroth, and they camped in the desert of Paran.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="13"><pasuk id="1">The Lord spoke to Moses saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="2">"Send out for yourself men who will scout the Land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel. You shall send one man each for his father's tribe; each one shall be a chieftain in their midst."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So Moses sent them from the desert of Paran by the word of the Lord. All of them were men of distinction; they were the heads of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">These are their names: For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zakkur.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">For the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">For the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jepphunneh.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">For the tribe of Issachar, Yigal the son of Joseph.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">For the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">For the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">For the tribe of Joseph, the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">For the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">For the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">For the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">For the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">These are the names of the men Moses sent to scout the Land, and Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Moses sent them to scout the Land of Canaan, and he said to them, "Go up this way in the south and climb up the mountain.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">You shall see what [kind of] land it is, and the people who inhabit it; are they strong or weak? Are there few or many?</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And what of the land they inhabit? Is it good or bad? And what of the cities in which they reside are they in camps or in fortresses?</pasuk><pasuk id="20">What is the soil like is it fat or lean? Are there any trees in it or not? You shall be courageous and take from the fruit of the land." It was the season when the first grapes begin to ripen.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">So they went up and explored the land, from the desert of Zin until Rehov, at the entrance to Hamath.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">They went up in, the south, and he came to Hebron, and there were Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of the giant. Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan of Egypt.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">They came to the Valley of Eshkol and they cut a branch with a cluster of grapes. They carried it on a pole between two [people] and [they also took] some pomegranates and figs.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">They called that place the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster [eshkol] the children of Israel cut from there.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">They returned from scouting the Land at the end of forty days.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">They went, and they came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the desert of Paran, to Kadesh. They brought them back a report, as well as to the entire congregation, and they showed them the fruit of the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">They told him and said, "We came to the land to which you sent us, and it is flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">However, the people who inhabit the land are mighty, and the cities are extremely huge and fortified, and there we saw even the offspring of the giant.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">The Amalekites dwell in the south land, while the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountainous region. The Canaanites dwell on the coast and alongside the Jordan."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Caleb silenced the people to [hear about] Moses, and he said, "We can surely go up and take possession of it, for we can indeed overcome it."</pasuk><pasuk id="31">But the men who went up with him said, "We are unable to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">They spread an [evil] report about the land which they had scouted, telling the children of Israel, "The land we passed through to explore is a land that consumes its inhabitants, and all the people we saw in it are men of stature.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">There we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, descended from the giants. In our eyes, we seemed like grasshoppers, and so we were in their eyes.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="14"><pasuk id="1">The entire community raised their voices and shouted, and the people wept on that night.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">All the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the entire congregation said, "If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Why does the Lord bring us to this land to fall by the sword; our wives and children will be as spoils. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">They said to each other, "Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt!"</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the entire congregation of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had scouted the land, tore their clothes.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">They spoke to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "The land we passed through to scout is an exceedingly good land.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">If the Lord desires us, He will bring us to this land and give it to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">But you shall not rebel against the Lord, and you will not fear the people of that land for they are [as] our bread. Their protection is removed from them, and the Lord is with us; do not fear them."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The entire congregation threatened to pelt them with stones, but the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">The Lord said to Moses, "How long will this people provoke Me? How much longer will they not believe in Me after all the signs I have performed in their midst?</pasuk><pasuk id="12">I will strike them with a plague and annihilate them; then I will make you into a nation, greater and stronger than they."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Moses said to the Lord, "But the Egyptians will hear that You have brought this nation out from its midst with great power.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">They will say about the inhabitants of this land, who have heard that You, O Lord, are in the midst of this people; that You, the Lord, appear to them eye to eye and that Your cloud rests over them. And You go before them with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire by night,</pasuk><pasuk id="15">and if You kill this nation like one man, the nations who have heard of Your reputation will say as follows:</pasuk><pasuk id="16">'Since the Lord lacked the ability to bring this nation to the Land which He swore to them, He slaughtered them in the desert.'</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Now, please, let the strength of the Lord be increased, as You spoke, saying.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">'The Lord is slow to anger and abundantly kind, forgiving iniquity and transgression, Who cleanses [some] and does not cleanse [others], Who visits the iniquities of parents on children, even to the third and fourth generations.'</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Please forgive the iniquity of this nation in accordance with your abounding kindness, as You have borne this people from Egypt until now."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the Lord said, "I have forgiven them in accordance with your word.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">However, as surely as I live, and as the glory of the Lord fills the earth...</pasuk><pasuk id="22">that all the people who perceived My glory, and the signs that I performed in Egypt and in the desert, yet they have tested me these ten times and not listened to My voice,</pasuk><pasuk id="23">if they will see the Land that I swore to their fathers, and all who provoked Me will not see it.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">But as for My servant Caleb, since he was possessed by another spirit, and he followed Me, I will bring him to the land to which he came, and his descendants will drive it[s inhabitants] out.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">The Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley. Tomorrow, turn back and journey into the desert toward the Red Sea."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="27">"How much longer will this evil congregation who are causing to complain against Me [exist]? The complaints of the children of Israel which they caused them to complain against Me, I have heard.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Say to them, 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'if not as you have spoken in My ears, so will I do to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">In this desert, your corpses shall fall; your entire number, all those from the age of twenty and up, who were counted, because you complained against Me.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">You shall [not] come into the Land concerning which I raised My hand that you would settle in it, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">As for your infants, of whom you said that they will be as spoils, I will bring them [there], and they will come to know the Land which You despised.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">But as for you, your corpses shall fall in this desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Your children shall wander in the desert for forty years and bear your defection until the last of your corpses has fallen in the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">According to the number of days which you toured the Land forty days, a day for each year, you will [thus] bear your iniquities for forty years; thus you will come to know My alienation.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">I, the Lord, have spoken if I will not do this to the entire evil congregation who have assembled against me; in this desert they will end, and there they will die.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">As for the men whom Moses had sent to scout the Land, who returned and caused the entire congregation to complain against him by spreading [a slanderous] report about the Land"</pasuk><pasuk id="37">the men who spread an evil report about the Land died in the plague, before the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of the men who went to tour the Land.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">Moses related all these words to the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">They arose early in the morning and ascended to the mountain top, saying, "We are ready to go up to the place of which the Lord spoke, for we have sinned. "</pasuk><pasuk id="41">Moses said, "Why do you transgress the word of the Lord? It will not succeed.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">Do not go up, for the Lord is not among you, [so that] you will not be beaten by your enemies.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will fall by the sword.

So Moses prayed on behalf of the people.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The Lord said to Moses, "Make yourself a serpent and put it on a pole, and let whoever is bitten look at it and live.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole, and whenever a snake bit a man, he would gaze upon the copper snake and live.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The children of Israel journeyed on and camped in Oboth.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">They journeyed from Oboth and camped in the wasteland passes in the wilderness, which faced Moab, toward the rising sun.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">From there they journeyed, and they encamped along the stream of Zered.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">From there they journeyed, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which was in the desert, extending from the Amorite border, for Arnon was the Moabite border between Moab and the Amorites.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Concerning this it is told in the account of the Wars of the Lord, "What He gave at the [Sea of] Reeds and the streams of Arnon.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the spilling of the streams that turned to settle at Ar and leaned toward the border of Moab.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">From there to the well; that is the well of which the Lord said to Moses, 'Gather the people, and I will give them water.'"</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Then Israel sang this song: "'Ascend, O well,' sing to it!</pasuk><pasuk id="18">A well dug by princes, carved out by nobles of the people, through the lawgiver with their staffs, and from the desert, a gift.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">From the gift, to the streams, and from the streams to the heights.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">From the heights to the valley in the field of Moab, at the top of the peak, that overlooks the wastelands."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Israel sent messengers to Sihon the king of the Amorites, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="22">"Let me pass through your land. We will not turn into fields or vineyards, nor drink well water. We shall walk along the king's road, until we have passed through your territory."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his territory, and Sihon gathered all his people and went out to the desert toward Israel. He arrived at Jahaz and fought against Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Israel smote him with the sword, and took possession of his land from Arnon to Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon, for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Israel took all these cities, and the Israelites dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and all its villages.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and he had fought against the first king of Moab, taking all his land from his possession, as far as Arnon.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Concerning this, those who speak in parables say, "Come to Heshbon, may it be built and established as the city of Sihon.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">For fire went forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the masters of the high places of Arnon.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Woe is to you, Moab; you are lost, people of Chemosh. His sons he has given over as refugees and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon, king of the Amorites.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Their kingdom is destroyed from Heshbon; it has been removed from Dibon; we laid them waste as far as Nophah which is near Medeba."</pasuk><pasuk id="31">Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">Moses sent [men] to spy out Jaazer and they captured its villages, driving out the Amorites who lived there.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Then they turned and headed north toward the Bashan. Og, the king of Bashan, came out toward them with all his people, to wage war at Edrei.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">The Lord said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have delivered him, his people, and his land into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites who dwells in Heshbon.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">They smote him, his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor, and they took possession of his land.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="22"><pasuk id="1">The children of Israel journeyed and encamped in the plains of Moab, across the Jordan from Jericho.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Moab became terrified of the people, for they were numerous, and Moab became disgusted because of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this assembly will eat up everything around us, as the ox eats up the greens of the field. Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of his people, to call for him, saying, "A people has come out of Egypt, and behold, they have covered the "eye" of the land, and they are stationed opposite me.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">So now, please come and curse this people for me, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I will be able to wage war against them and drive them out of the land, for I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed."</pasuk><pasuk id="7">So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went, with magic charms in their hands, and they came to Balaam and conveyed Balak's message to him.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">He said to them, "Lodge here for the night, and I will give you an answer when the Lord speaks to me." So the Moabite nobles stayed with Balaam.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor the king of Moab has sent [them] to me, [saying]:</pasuk><pasuk id="11">"Behold the people coming out of Egypt, a nation, has covered the 'eye' of the earth. Come and curse them for me, perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them out."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them! You shall not curse the people because they are blessed."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">When Balaam arose in the morning, he said to Balak's nobles, "Return to your country, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Moab's nobles arose and came to Balak and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">So Balak continued to send dignitaries, more and higher in rank than these.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">They came to Balaam and said to him, "So said Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please do not hesitate to come to me.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For I will honor you greatly and do whatever you tell me to do. So please come and curse this people for me.'"</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Balaam answered and said to Balak's servants, "Even if Balak gives me a house full of silver and gold, I cannot do anything small or great that would transgress the word of the Lord, my God.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now, you too, please remain here overnight, and I will know what the Lord will continue to speak with me."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If these men have come to call for you, arise and go with them, but the word I speak to you-that you shall do."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">In the morning Balaam arose, saddled his she-donkey and went with the Moabite dignitaries.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">God's wrath flared because he was going, and an angel of the Lord stationed himself on the road to thwart him, and he was riding on his she-donkey, and his two servants were with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">The she-donkey saw the angel of the Lord stationed on the road with his sword drawn in his hand; so the she-donkey turned aside from the road and went into a field. Balaam beat the she-donkey to get it back onto the road.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">The angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, with a fence on this side and a fence on that side.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">The she-donkey saw the angel of the Lord, and she was pressed against the wall. She pressed Balaam's leg against the wall, and he beat her again.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">The angel of the Lord continued going ahead, and he stood in a narrow place, where there was no room to turn right or left.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">The she-donkey saw the angel of the Lord, and it crouched down under Balaam. Balaam's anger flared, and he beat the she-donkey with a stick.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">The Lord opened the mouth of the she-donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?"</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Balaam said to the she-donkey, "For you have humiliated me; if I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">The she-donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your she-donkey on which you have ridden since you first started until now? Have I been accustomed to do this to you?" He said, "No."</pasuk><pasuk id="31">The Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road, with a sword drawn in his hand. He bowed and prostrated himself on his face.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">The angel of the Lord said to him, "Why have you beaten your she-donkey these three times? Behold, I have came out to thwart you, for the one embarking on the journey has hastened against me.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">When the she-donkey saw me, it turned aside these three times. Had she not turned aside before me, now also I would also have killed you and spared her [the she-donkey]."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing on the road before me. Now, if it displeases you, I will return."</pasuk><pasuk id="35">The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, "Go with these men, but the word I will speak to you-that you shall speak." So Balaam went with Balak's dignitaries.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">Balak heard that Balaam was coming; so he went out toward him to the city of Moab which is on the border of Arnon-at the extreme edge of the border.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send to you to call for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I indeed incapable of honoring you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="38">Balaam said to Balak, "Behold I have come to you, do I have any power to say anything? The word God puts into my mouth-that I will speak."</pasuk><pasuk id="39">Balaam went with Balak, and they arrived at Kiryath Huzoth [a city of streets].</pasuk><pasuk id="40">Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and sent [some] to Balaam and to the dignitaries with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And in the morning Balak took Balaam and led him up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he saw part of the people.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="23"><pasuk id="1">Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams."</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Balak did as Balaam had requested, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the Lord will happen to appear to me, and He will show me something that I can tell you," and he went alone.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">God chanced upon Balaam, and he said to Him, "I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The Lord placed something into Balaam's mouth, and He said, "Return to Balak and say as follows."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">When he returned, Balak was standing next to his burnt offering, he and all the Moabite dignitaries.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">He took up his parable and said, "Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east [saying], 'Come, curse Jacob for me and come invoke wrath against Israel.'</pasuk><pasuk id="8">How can I curse whom God has not cursed, and how can I invoke wrath if the Lord has not been angered?</pasuk><pasuk id="9">For from their beginning, I see them as mountain peaks, and I behold them as hills; it is a nation that will dwell alone, and will not be reckoned among the nations.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Who counted the dust of Jacob or the number of a fourth of [or, of the seed of] Israel? May my soul die the death of the upright and let my end be like his."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them!"</pasuk><pasuk id="12">He answered, saying, "What the Lord puts into my mouth that I must take care to say."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place from where you will see them; however, you will see only a part of them, not all of them and curse them for me from there.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">He took him to the field of the lookouts, to the peak of the mountain, and he built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">He said to Balak, "Stand here next to your burnt offering and I will be chanced on here.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">The Lord chanced upon Balaam and placed something into his mouth. He said, "Return to Balak and so you shall speak."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">When he came to him, he was standing next to his burnt offering, and the Moabite dignitaries were with him, and Balak said to him, "What did the Lord speak?"</pasuk><pasuk id="18">He took up his parable and said, "Arise, Balak, and hear; listen closely to me, son of Zippor.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">God is not a man that He should lie, nor is He a mortal that He should relent. Would He say and not do, speak and not fulfill?</pasuk><pasuk id="20">I have received [an instruction] to bless, and He has blessed, and I cannot retract it.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">He does not look at evil in Jacob, and has seen no perversity in Israel; the Lord, his God, is with him, and he has the King's friendship.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">God has brought them out of Egypt with the strength of His loftiness.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">For there is no divination in Jacob and no soothsaying in Israel. In time it will be said to Jacob and Israel, 'What has God wrought?'</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Behold, a people that rises like a lioness (See Malbim) and raises itself like a lion. It does not lie down until it eats its prey and drinks the blood of the slain."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Balak said to Balaam, "You shall neither curse them nor shall you bless them."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">Balaam answered and said to Balak, "Have I not spoken to you, saying, 'Everything the Lord speaks that I shall do."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to a different place. Perhaps it will please God, and you will curse them for me from there.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">So Balak took Balaam to the peak of Peor, overlooking the wastelands.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Balak did as Balaam told him, and offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="24"><pasuk id="1">Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel; so he did not go in search of omens as he had done time and time again, but turned his face toward the desert.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the spirit of God rested upon him.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">He took up his parable and said, "The word of Balaam the son of Beor and the word of the man with an open eye.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The word of the one who hears God's sayings, who sees the vision of the Almighty, fallen yet with open eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!</pasuk><pasuk id="6">They extend like streams, like gardens by the river, like aloes which the Lord planted, like cedars by the water.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Water will flow from his wells, and his seed shall have abundant water; his king shall be raised over Agag, and his kingship exalted.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">God, Who has brought them out of Egypt with the strength of His loftiness He shall consume the nations which are his adversaries, bare their bones and dip His arrows [into their blood].</pasuk><pasuk id="9">He crouches and lies like a lion and like a lioness; who will dare rouse him? Those who bless you shall be blessed, and those who curse you shall be cursed.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Balak's anger flared against Balaam, and he clapped his hands. Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Now, hurry back to your place. I said I would honor you greatly, but the Lord has deprived you of honor."</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Balaam said to Balak, "But I even told the messengers you sent to me, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="13">'If Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot transgress the word of the Lord to do either good or evil on my own; only what the Lord speaks can I speak.'</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And now, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you...what this people will do to your people at the end of days."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">He took up his parable and said, "The word of Balaam, son of Beor, the word of a man with an open eye.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">The word of the one who hears God's sayings and perceives the thoughts of the Most High; who sees the vision of the Almighty, fallen yet with open eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">I see it, but not now; I behold it, but not soon.

Who can survive these things from God?</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Ships will come from the Kittites and afflict Assyria and afflict those on the other side, but he too will perish forever."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Balaam arose, went, and returned home, and Balak went on his way.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="25"><pasuk id="1">Israel settled in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of the Moabites.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and prostrated themselves to their gods.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Israel became attached to Baal Peor, and the anger of the Lord flared against Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">The Lord said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and hang them before the Lord, facing the sun, and then the flaring anger of the Lord will be removed from Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you shall kill the men who became attached to Baal Peor.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Then an Israelite man came and brought the Midianite woman to his brethren, before the eyes of Moses and before the eyes of the entire congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the kohen saw this, arose from the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">He went after the Israelite man into the chamber and drove [it through] both of them;
