<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on that side of the Jordan in the desert, in the plain opposite the Red Sea, between Paran and Tofel and Lavan and Hazeroth and Di Zahav.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">"It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">It came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord had commanded him regarding them;</pasuk><pasuk id="4">After he had smitten Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og, king of the Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth in Edrei.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">On that side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses commenced [and] explained this Law, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="6">"The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, 'You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Turn and journey, and come to the mountain of the Amorites and to all its neighboring places, in the plain, on the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and the Lebanon, until the great river, the Euphrates River.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">See, I have set the land before you; come and possess the land which the Lord swore to your forefathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them and their descendants after them.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I said to you at that time, saying, 'I cannot carry you alone.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The Lord, your God, has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the heavens in abundance.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">May the Lord God of your forefathers add to you a thousandfold as many as you are, and may He bless you, as He spoke concerning you!</pasuk><pasuk id="12">How can I bear your trouble, your burden, and your strife all by myself?</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Prepare for yourselves wise and understanding men, known among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And you answered me and said, 'The thing you have spoken is good for us to do.'</pasuk><pasuk id="15">So I took the heads of your tribes, men wise and well known, and I made them heads over you, leaders over thousands, leaders over hundreds, leaders over fifties, and leaders over tens, and officers, over your tribes.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Hear [disputes] between your brothers and judge justly between a man and his brother, and between his litigant.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">You shall not favor persons in judgment; [rather] you shall hear the small just as the great; you shall not fear any man, for the judgment is upon the Lord, and the case that is too difficult for you, bring to me, and I will hear it."</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And I commanded you at that time all the things you should do.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And we journeyed from Horeb and went through all that great and fearful desert, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord, our God, commanded us; and we came up to Kadesh barnea.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And I said to you, "You have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord, our God, is giving us.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Behold, the Lord, your God, has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as the Lord, God of your fathers has spoken to you; you shall neither fear nor be dismayed."</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And all of you approached me and said, "Let us send men ahead of us so that they will search out the land for us and bring us back word by which route we shall go up, and to which cities we shall come."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the matter pleased me; so I took twelve men from you, one man for each tribe.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And they turned and went up to the mountain, and they came to the valley of Eshkol and spied it out.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they took some of the fruit of the land in their hand[s] and brought it down to us, brought us back word, and said, "The land the Lord, our God, is giving us is good."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">But you did not want to go up, and you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, your God.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">You murmured in your tents and said, '"Because the Lord hates us, He took us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand[s] of the Amorites to exterminate us."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Where shall we go up? Our brothers have discouraged us, saying, "A people greater and taller than we; cities great and fortified up to the heavens, and we have even seen the sons of Anakim there."</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And I said to you, "Do not be broken or afraid of them.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">The Lord, your God, Who goes before you He will fight for you, just as He did for you in Egypt before your very eyes,</pasuk><pasuk id="31">and in the desert, where you have seen how the Lord, your God, has carried you as a man carries his son, all the way that you have gone, until you have come to this place.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">But regarding this matter, you do not believe the Lord, your God,</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Who goes before you on the way, to search out a place for you, in which to encamp, in fire at night, to enable you to see on the way you should go, and in a cloud by day."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And the Lord heard the sound of your words, and He became angry and swore, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="35">'If any of these men of this evil generation sees the good land, which I swore to give your forefathers,</pasuk><pasuk id="36">except Caleb the son of Jephunneh he will see it, and I will give him the land he trod upon, and to his children, because he has completely followed the Lord."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">The Lord was also angry with me because of you, saying, "Neither will you go there.</pasuk><pasuk id="38">But Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you he will go there; strengthen him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">[Moreover] your little ones, whom you said will be prey, and your children, who on that day did not know good and evil they will go there and I will give it to them, and they will possess it.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">But as for you, turn yourselves around and journey into the desert by way of the Red Sea."</pasuk><pasuk id="41">Then you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against the Lord; we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord, our God, has commanded us." So every one of you girded his weapons, and you prepared yourselves to go up to the mountain.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And the Lord said to me, "Say to them, 'Neither go up nor fight, for I am not among you, lest you be struck down before your enemies.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="43">So I spoke to you, but you did not listen, and you rebelled against the command of the Lord, and you acted wickedly and went up to the mountain.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And the Amorites, dwelling in that mountain, came out towards you and pursued you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, as far as Hormah.</pasuk><pasuk id="45">So you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not hear your voice, nor would he listen to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="46">And you dwelled in Kadesh many days, as the days that you dwelled.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">Then we turned and journeyed into the desert by way of the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me, and we circled Mount Seir for many days.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord spoke to me, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="3">You have circled this mountain long enough; turn northward.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And command the people saying, You are about to pass through the boundary of your kinsmen, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. Be very careful.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">You shall not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land not so much as a foot step, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for an inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat, and also water you shall buy from them with money, that you may drink.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">For the Lord, your God, has blessed you in all the work of your hand; He knows of your walking through this great desert; these forty years that the Lord your God has been with you, you have lacked nothing.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And we departed from our kinsmen, the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by way of the plain from Elath and from Etzion Geber, and we turned and passed through the way of the desert of Moab.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the Lord said to me, Do not distress the Moabites, and do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land [as] an inheritance, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot [as] an inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The Emim dwelt there formerly, a great and numerous people, and tall [in stature], as the Anakim;</pasuk><pasuk id="11">They also are considered Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, and the children of Esau were driving them out, and they exterminated them from before them and dwelt in their stead, just as the Israelites did to the land of their inheritance, which the Lord gave them.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Now get up and cross the brook of Zered. So we crossed the brook of Zered.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the days when we went from Kadesh barnea, until we crossed the brook of Zered, numbered thirty eight years, until all the generation of the men of war expired from the midst of the camp, just as the Lord swore to them.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Also the hand of the Lord was upon them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">So it was, when all the men of war finished dying from among the people,</pasuk><pasuk id="17">that the Lord spoke to me saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Today you are crossing the boundary of Moab at Ar.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And when you approach opposite the children of Ammon, neither distress them, nor provoke them, for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon as an inheritance, because I have given it to the children of Lot as an inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">It too is considered a land of Rephaim; Rephaim dwelt therein formerly, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">A great, numerous and tall people as the Anakim, but the Lord exterminated them before them, and they drove them out and dwelt in their stead.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">As He did to the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when He exterminated the Horites from before them; and they drove them out and dwelt in their stead even to this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">But the Avim, who dwell in open cities, up till Gaza -- the Caphtorites, who came forth of Caphtor, exterminated them, and dwelt in their stead.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Get up, journey, and cross the river Arnon. Behold, I have delivered into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: Begin to possess it, and provoke him to war.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the nations that are under the entire heaven, who will hear reports of you and shake and be in trepidation because of you.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">So I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="27">"Allow me to pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right nor to the left."</pasuk><pasuk id="28">You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give to me water for money, that I may drink; I will only pass through by my feet.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">Just as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did for me; until I cross the Jordan to the land which the Lord our God is giving us."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">But Sihon, king of Heshbon, did not wish to let us pass by him, for the Lord your God caused his spirit to be hardened and his heart to be obstinate, in order that He would give him into your hand, as this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And the Lord said to me, "Behold I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land before you; begin to drive him out, that you may inherit his land."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">Then Sihon went forth towards us, he and all his people, to war at Jahzah.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And the Lord our God delivered him to us; and we smote him and his sons and all his people.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And we conquered all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, the men, women, and the young children; we left over no survivor.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley,even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us: the Lord our God delivered up all before us.</pasuk><pasuk id="37">Only to the land of the children of Ammon you came not near; all the side of the river Yabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the Lord our God commanded us.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">Then we turned and went up the way of Bashan, and Og, the king of Bashan, came forth toward us, he and all his people, to war at Edrei</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord said to me, "Do not fear him, for I have given him, all his people, and his land into your hand, and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So the Lord, our God, delivered into our hands also Og, the king of Bashan and all his people, and we smote him until no remnant remained of him.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And we conquered all his cities at that time; there was not a town that we did not take from them sixty cities, all the territory of Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">All these cities were fortified with high walls, double doors, and bolts, in addition to a great many unwalled cities.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And we utterly destroyed them as we did to Sihon, king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, the men, the women, and the young children.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">But all the beasts and the spoils of the cities, we took as spoil for ourselves.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">At that time we took the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites who were on that side of the Jordan, from the brook of Arnon to Mount Hermon.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. His bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the cubit of a man.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And this land, which we possessed at that time; from Aro'er, which is by the brook of Arnon, and half of Mount Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the territory of Argob, all of Bashan; that is called the land of Rephaim.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the territory of Argob to the boundaries of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and he called them, even Bashan, after his own name, villages of Jair, to this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And to Machir I gave Gilead.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead to the brook of Arnon, the midst of the brook and the border, until the brook of Jabbok, which is the boundary of the children of Ammon,</pasuk><pasuk id="17">the plain, the Jordan and the border thereof, from Kinnereth to the sea of the plain the Sea of Salt, under the waterfalls of Pisgah, eastward.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And I commanded you at that time saying, "The Lord, your God, has given you this land to possess it; pass over, armed, before your brothers, the children of Israel, all who are warriors.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">But your wives, your young children, and your cattle for I know that you have much cattle shall dwell in your cities which I have given you,</pasuk><pasuk id="20">until the Lord has given rest to your brothers, just as [He did] for you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord, your God, is giving them on the other side of the Jordan, then every man shall return to his possession, which I have given to you."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that the Lord, your God, has done to these two kings. So will the Lord do to all the kingdoms through which you will pass.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Do not fear them, for it is the Lord, your God, Who is fighting for you."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">I entreated the Lord at that time, saying,</pasuk><pasuk id="24">"O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for who is [like] God in heaven or on earth who can do as Your deeds and Your might?</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Pray let me cross over and see the good land that is on the other side of the Jordan, this good mountain and the Lebanon."</pasuk><pasuk id="26">But the Lord was angry with me because of you, and He did not listen to me, and the Lord said to me, "It is enough for you; speak to Me no more regarding this matter.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">Go up to the top of the hill and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and see with your eyes, for you shall not cross this Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">But command Joshua and strengthen him and encourage him, for he will cross over before this people, and he will make them inherit the land which you will see.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And we abided in the valley opposite Beth Peor.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And now, O Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the judgments which I teach you to do, in order that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord, God of your forefathers, is giving you.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Do not add to the word which I command you, nor diminish from it, to observe the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor, for every man who went after Baal Peor, the Lord your God has exterminated from your midst.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">But you who cleave to the Lord your God are alive, all of you, this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, as the Lord, my God, commanded me, to do so in the midst of the land to which you are coming to possess.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And you shall keep [them] and do [them], for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the peoples, who will hear all these statutes and say, "Only this great nation is a wise and understanding people.

Consequently, the evil will befall you at the end of days, because you did evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Then, Moses spoke into the ears of the entire assembly of Israel the words of the following song, until their completion.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="32"><pasuk id="1">Listen, O heavens, and I will speak!

Ask your father, and he will tell you; your elders, and they will inform you.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">When the Most High gave nations their lot, when He separated the sons of man, He set up the boundaries of peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Because the Lord's portion is His people Jacob, the lot of His inheritance.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">He found them in a desert land, and in a desolate, howling wasteland.

Thus, I will provoke their jealousy with a non people, provoke their anger with a foolish nation.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">For a fire blazed in My wrath, and burned to the lowest depths. It consumed the land and its produce, setting aflame the foundations of mountains.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">I will link evils upon them. I will use up My arrows on them.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">They will sprout hair from famine, attacked by demons, excised by Meriri.

The Lord did none of this!"</pasuk><pasuk id="28">For they are a nation devoid of counsel, and they have no understanding.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">If they were wise, they would understand this; they would reflect upon their fate.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">How can one [person] pursue a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their [Mighty] Rock has sold them out, and the Lord has given them over?</pasuk><pasuk id="31">For their rock is not like our [Mighty] Rock. Nevertheless, our enemies sit in judgment.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the field of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of rosh, and they have bitter clusters.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Their wine is the bitterness of serpents, and the bitterness of the ruthless cobras.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">Is it not stored up with Me, sealed up in My treasuries?</pasuk><pasuk id="35">Vengeance is poised with Me, and it will pay at the time their foot stumbles.
