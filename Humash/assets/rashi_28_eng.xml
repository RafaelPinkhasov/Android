    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="righteousness, justice, and equity: ">“Righteousness” denotes charity from his money; “justice” means to judge honestly, and “equity” denotes compromise-the smooth and straight road, equal to this one and to that one.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="To give prudence to the simple: ">Koheleth stated these proverbs so that the simple should gain prudence.</text>

    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="6">
      <text title="to understand an allegory and a figure: ">That they should direct their attention to understand the verses through two methods: the allegory and the figure. They should understand what he compares to the figure, but they should not neglect the figure itself, for that, too, requires understanding. When he states, “To save you from a strange woman and a foreign one” (2: 16), idolatry is meant; this is the allegory, and also the figure-for he expressed his allegory in terms of a woman-should be understood by it, [meaning that] you shall beware of a strange woman (other editions: a harlot).</text>

      <text title="The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: ">Until here, he explained for what purpose Solomon composed this book, and now the book commences.</text>
      <text title="The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: ">This is the separation of the fundamentals of knowledge, and what shall be for you first, preceding knowledge: Before your wisdom, first fear your Creator, and that will give your heart the desire to engage in wisdom and in knowledge, for the fools, who do not fear the Lord, despise wisdom and discipline.</text>
    </pasuk>

      <text title="Hearken, my son, to the discipline of your father: ">What the Holy One, blessed be He, gave Moses in writing and orally.</text>

    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="9">
      <text title="a wreath of grace: ">They are a wreath of grace for your head; i.e., the instruction and the discipline will be a wreath of grace for your head, and they shall be like the rings of a golden ornament.</text>

      <text title="like the grave: ">which swallows up the entire body.</text>
      <text title="and the whole ones: ">Heb. ותמימים. This is not an expression of righteous men, but an expression of whole ones. Let us swallow them up when they are whole, like a man who descends into a pit when he is whole; i.e., when they are still wealthy, let us slay them and inherit their property.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="14">
      <text title="Cast your lot among us: ">If you wish, you may share; if you wish, it will be common property.</text>

      <text title="Lest you weigh the path of life: ">So did the Sages (Tanhuma Ekev 2) expound it: The Holy One, blessed be He, moved away (טלטל) the reward for the commandments and did not explain it [the reward], so that a person should not see a commandment for which the reward is great and cling to it and leave over the other commandments. This is the interpretation: Lest you weigh the ways of the Torah, which one to take and which one to leave, therefore its paths wandered off-God caused them to wander off and He did not make them known. This is the Midrash Aggadah, but according to the sequence of the verses, since after it is written: “And now, children, hearken to me and do not turn away from the sayings of my mouth. Distance your way from her,” it appears that he has not yet ended the section dealing with the harlot, and it should be interpreted as follows:</text>
      <text title="Lest you weigh the path of life: ">Do not weigh the path of life in conjunction with that strange one, saying what to do, whether this one or this one [i.e., whether to follow the path of life or the path of the strange woman], for the paths of the harlot have wandered off to the grave, and you will not know how to beware until you wander off and fall.</text>
