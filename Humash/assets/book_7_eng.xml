" And Simeon went with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Judah went up; and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands; and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they found Adoni- bezek in Bezek and fought with him: and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued him: and they caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered (food) under my table; as I have done, so has God punished me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and set the city on fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites; the inhabitants of the mountains, of the South, and of the lowland.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Judah went to the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron-Now the name of Hebron formerly had been Kirjath-arba-and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And from there he went to the inhabitants of Debir-Now the name of Debir formerly had been Kirjath-sepher.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Caleb said, "He that shall smite Kirjath-sepher and capture it; to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And it was when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask of her father the field, and she leaned off the donkey.

Now the name of the city formerly was Luz.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the watchers saw a man leave the city. And they said to him, "Show us now the entrance to the city and we will deal kindly with you."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And he showed them the entrance of the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but the man and his entire family they let go.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the man went to the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz; this is its name until this day.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Menasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shean and its towns, Taanach and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Yibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; and the Canaanites wanted to remain in this land.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And it was when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but they did not drive them out.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; and the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; and the Canaanites dwelt among them and became tributary.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Akko, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Achlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Chelbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rechob.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-Anath; and he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land.

"</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And it was while the messenger of the Lord was saying these words to all the children of Israel, that the nation raised their voices and cried.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And they called the name of that place Bochim and they sacrificed to the Lord there.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Joshua had sent away the nation, and the children of Israel went, each man to his inheritance to possess the land.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the nation served the Lord during all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua and who had seen all the great deed of the Lord that He had performed for Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred and ten years old.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnath Cheres on the mountain of Ephraim, to the north of Mount Gaash.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And also all that generation were gathered to their forefathers, and there arose another generation after them, who knew not the Lord nor the deed which He had done for Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord and they served the Baalim.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they forsook the God of their forefathers, Who had brought them up from the land of Egypt, and they went after other gods, of the gods of the nations that were around them, and they bowed to them and they provoked the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And they forsook the Lord and served the Baal and the Ashtaroth.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of spoilers and they spoiled them, and He gave them over into the hands of their enemies around, and they could no longer stand before their enemies.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had spoken and as the Lord had sworn to them, and they were greatly distressed.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the Lord raised up judges and they saved them from the hands of those who had spoiled them.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">But also their judges they did not obey, for they went astray after other gods, and they bowed to them; they turned aside quickly from the way wherein their forefathers had walked, obeying the commandments of the Lord, (but) they did not do so.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge and saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge, for the Lord retracted, because of their cry by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And it was when the judge died, that they would return and deal more corruptly than their forefathers, going after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them; they did not diminish of their practices nor of their stubborn way.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and He said, "Because this nation has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their forefathers and have not obeyed Me,</pasuk><pasuk id="21">I too will not continue to drive out any man from before them, of the nations that Joshua left and he died.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">In order to test Israel through them, whether they would keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as their forefathers did keep it, or not."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the Lord left these nations without driving them out hastily, and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">Now these are the nations which the Lord left through whom to test Israel, all those that had not known all the wars of Canaan.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">Only that the generations of the children of Israel should know, to teach them war, just the earlier ones did not know thereof.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">The five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon to the passageway of Hamath.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they were to test through them Israel, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord which He had commanded their forefathers through Moses.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and served their gods.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the children of Israel did that which displeased the Lord, and they forgot the Lord their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and He gave them over into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Aram-naharaim; and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And the children of Israel cried to the Lord, and the Lord raised up a savior to the children of Israel who saved them; Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, who was younger than he.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the Lord delivered into his hands Cushan-rishathaim the king of Aram; and his hand prevailed upon Cushan-rishathaim.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the land had rest forty years; then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the children of Israel continued to do that which displeased the Lord; and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which displeased the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of the date palms.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the children of Israel cried to the Lord, and the Lord raised up for them a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man with a shriveled right hand; and the children of Israel sent through him a present to Eglon the king of Moab.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Ehud made for himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit was its length; and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he offered the present to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And it was when he had finished offering the present, that he escorted the people who had carried the present.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And he turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal and said, "I have a secret errand with you O King." And he said, "Be quiet," and all that stood near him went out.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And Ehud came to him, and he was sitting by himself in the cool upper room which he had for himself, and Ehud said, "I have a message from God to you," and he stood up from the chair.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Ehud stretched out his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade, because he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the excrement came out.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Ehud went out to the porch and shut the doors of the upper room in front of him, and locked them.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Now when he had gone out, his servants came and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, "Surely he is covering his feet in the cool room."</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they tarried until it was late, and behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room; and they took the key and opened them, and behold their lord was fallen down on the earth, dead.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Ehud escaped while they lingered; and he passed beyond the quarries and escaped to Seirah.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And it was when he came, that he blew the trumpet on the mountain of Ephriam; and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountain, and he was before them.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And he said to them, "Follow me quickly, for the Lord has given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands." And they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan to Moab, and did not permit any man to pass.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And they killed of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty (man) and every man of valor; and no man escaped.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And Moab was subdued on that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, and he killed the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also saved Israel.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="4"><pasuk id="1">And the children of Israel continued to do that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and Ehud was dead.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord gave them over into the hand of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the chieftain of his army was Sisera, and he dwelt in Harosheth-goiim.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the children of Israel mightily for twenty years.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Now Deborah was a woman prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth; she judged Israel at that time.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And she sat under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el, in the mountain of Ephriam; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali. And she said to him, "Indeed the Lord, God of Israel, commanded, 'Go and draw toward Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And I shall draw to you, to the brook Kishon, Sisera, the chieftain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will give him into your hand.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And Barak said to her, "If you will go with me then I shall go, but if you will not go with me, I shall not go."</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And she said, "I shall surely go with you, but your glory will not be on the way which you go, for into the hand of a woman will the Lord deliver Sisera." And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And Barak gathered Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up at his feet; and Deborah went up with him.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses; and he pitched his tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And they told Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Sisera gathered all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-goiim, to the brook Kishon.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And Deborah said to Barak, "Rise, for this is the day which the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. Did not the Lord go out before you?" And Barak went down from Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men after him.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the Lord confused Sisera and all the chariots and all of the camp with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled on foot.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And Barak pursued the chariots and the camp, to Harosheth-goiim; and all of Sisera's camp fell by the edge of the sword, not even one was left.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not." And he turned in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a garment.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And he said to her, "Give me now a little water to drink, for I am thirsty;" and she opened the flask of milk and gave him to drink, and covered him.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he said to her, "Stand in the doorway of the tent; and it shall be, if any man comes and asks you and says, 'Is a man here?,' then you shall say, 'There is not.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Jael, the wife of Heber, took the tent-pin, and placed the hammer in her hand, and came to him stealthily, and thrust the pin into his temple, and it pierced through into the ground; and he was in a deep sleep and weary; and he died.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And behold, Barak pursued Sisera, and Jael came out to meet him, and she said to him, "Come and I will show you the man whom you seek," and he came to her, and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the pin was in his temple.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan, before the children of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed constantly harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin, king of Canaan.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="5"><pasuk id="1">Now Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">"When breaches are made in Israel, when the people offer themselves willingly, bless the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Hear, O kings, give ear, O princes; I, to the Lord I shall sing, I shall sing to the Lord, the God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Lord, when You went forth out of Seir, when You marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dripped; also the clouds dripped water.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">The mountains melted at the presence of the Lord, this (was at) Sinai, because of the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, caravans ceased, and travellers walked on crooked paths.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">The open cities ceased, in Israel they ceased, until I Deborah arose; I arose as a mother in Israel.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">When they chose new gods, then there was war in the cities; was there seen a shield or a spear (when the) forty thousand (went against) Israel?</pasuk><pasuk id="9">My heart is toward the lawgivers of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people, (saying,) 'Bless the Lord.'</pasuk><pasuk id="10">The riders of white donkeys, those that sit in judgment, and those that walk on the path, tell of it.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Instead of the noise of adversaries, between the places of drawing water, there they will tell the righteous acts of the Lord, the righteous acts of restoring open cities in Israel. Then the people of the Lord went down to the cities.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Praise! Praise! Deborah. Praise! Praise! Utter a song. Arise Barak, and capture your captives, son of Abinoam.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Then ruled a remnant among the mighty of the nations; the Lord dominated the strong for me.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Out of Ephraim, whose root was against Amalek; after you (will be) Benjamin with your abaters; out of Machir came down officers, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the scribe.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah, as was Issachar with Barak; into the valley they rushed forth with their feet. (But) among the divisions of Reuben, (there were) great resolves of heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Why do you sit between the borders, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? At the divisions of Reuben, (there are) great searchings of heart.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Gilead abides beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why does he gather into the ships? Asher dwelt at the shore of the seas, and by his breaches he abides.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Zebulun is a people that jeopardized their lives to die, as did Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">The kings came and fought; then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">From heaven they fought; the stars from their courses fought against Sisera.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">The brook Kishon swept them away, that ancient brook, the brook Kishon; tread down, O my soul, (their) strength.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Then were pounded the heels of the horses by reason of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">'Curse you Meroz,' said the messenger of the Lord, 'curse you bitterly (you) inhabitants thereof,' because they came not to the aid of the Lord, to the aid of the Lord against the mighty.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be; above women in the tent shall she be blessed.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Water he requested, (but) milk she gave him: in a lordly bowl she brought him cream.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">She put forth her hand to the pin, and her right hand to strike the weary; she struck Sisera, pierced his head, and wounded and penetrated his temple.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">At her feet he sank, fell, lay; at her feet he sank (and) fell; where he sank, there he fell down dead.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Through the window the mother of Sisera looked forth, and peered through the window; why is his chariot late in coming?

And the land rested forty years.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="6"><pasuk id="1">And the children of Israel did that which displeased the Lord, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian (for) seven years.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the children of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains and the caves, and the strongholds.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And it was, when Israel had sown, that Midian came up, and Amalek, and those of the east; and they came up upon it.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they encamped against them, and they destroyed the produce of the earth, until you come to Gaza. They would leave no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">For they and their cattle came up, and their tents, and they came as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels without number, and they came into the land to destroy it.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And Israel was very impoverished because of Midian, and the children of Israel cried to the Lord.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Now it was when the children of Israel cried to the Lord concerning Midian,</pasuk><pasuk id="8">that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, and he said to them, "Thus says the Lord, God of Israel; I brought you up from Egypt, and I brought you out of the house of bondage.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And I saved you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of all your oppressors; and I drove them out from before you, and I have given you their land.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And I said to you, 'I am the Lord your God, you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed me."</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And the angel of the Lord came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophra, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to be enabled to flee from Midian.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the angel of the Lord appeared and said to him, "The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor."</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Gideon said to him, "Please my lord, if the Lord be with us, why then has all this befallen us? And where are all His wonders which our forefathers told us, saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?' But now the Lord has forsaken us, and He has delivered us into the hand of Midian."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And the Lord turned toward him and said, "Go, with this your strength, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?"</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he said to Him, "Please O Lord, with what shall I save Israel? Behold, my thousand is the poorest in Menasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's household."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And the Lord said to him, "Because I shall be with you, and you shall strike Midian as one man."</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he said to Him, "If I have now found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is You that speaks with me.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Do not move from here now until I come to you, and I shall bring out my offering, and lay it before you." And he said, "I shall tarry until you return."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And Gideon came and prepared a young goat, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal; the meat he put in the basket, and the broth he put in the pot. And he brought it out to him under the oak and presented it.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the Angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and the broth pour out." And he did so.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and he touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the fire went up out of the rock, and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes, and the angel of the Lord departed from before his eyes.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Now Gideon saw that he was an angel of the Lord, and Gideon said, "Alas, O Lord God! Because I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And the Lord said to him, "Peace be to you, fear not, you shall not die."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Gideon built an altar to the Lord there, and he called it, "Lord (who bestows upon us) peace." Until this day, it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">Now it was on that night, that the Lord said to him, "Take the bullock that your father has, and the second bullock, seven years. And you shall destroy the altar of the Baal which belongs to your father, and the Asherah which is next to it shall you cut down.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And you shall build an altar to the Lord your God upon the top of this rock, in the proper place. And you shall take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down."</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had spoken to him. Now it was, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, to do it by day, that he did it at night.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And the men of the city arose early in the morning, and behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah that was next to it, was cut down. And the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And they said one to another, "Who has done this thing?" And they inquired and sought, and they said, "Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And the men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son that he may die, because he has broken the altar of the Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was next to it."</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And Joash said to all that stood by him, "Will you contend for the Baal? Will you avenge him? He that will contend for him, shall be put to death; (tarry) until morning. If he be a god, let him contend for himself, because he has broken his altar."</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And he called him on that day "Jerubbaal," saying, "Let Baal contend with him, because he has broken down his altar."</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And all the Midianites and the Amalekites and those of the east assembled together. And they crossed and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And a spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon, and he blew the trumpet, and Abiezer gathered following him.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And he sent messengers throughout all Menasseh, and they too gathered after him, and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali, and they came up towards them.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Gideon said to God, "If You will save Israel by my hand, as You have spoken,</pasuk><pasuk id="37">behold, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there be dew only on the fleece, and upon all the ground it be dry, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have spoken."</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And it was so, (for) he rose up early on the morrow and pressed the fleece together, and he wrung dew out of the fleece; a bowl full of water.</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And Gideon said to God, "Let not Your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Let me now experiment but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And God did so on that night. And it was dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground there was dew.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="7"><pasuk id="1">And Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, arose early, and all the people that were with him, and they encamped beside En- harod, and the camp of Midian was on the north side of him by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord said to Gideon, "The people that are with you are too numerous for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'</pasuk><pasuk id="3">So now proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead.' " And there returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and ten thousand remained.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And the Lord said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will purify them for you there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to you, 'This (one) shall go with you,' he shall go with you, and of whomsoever I shall say to you, 'This (one) shall not go with you,' he shall not go."</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he brought down the people to the water. Then the Lord said to Gideon, "Everyone who laps with his tongue as the dog laps, him shall you set by himself, and (likewise) every one that kneels upon his knees to drink."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Now it was the number of those that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, three hundred men, and all the rest of the people kneeled upon their knees to drink water.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And the Lord said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and I will give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the (other) people go each to his place."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And they took the provisions of the people in their hands, and their trumpets; and all the rest of the men of Israel he sent each to his tent, but the three hundred men he retained. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And it was on that night, that the Lord said to him, "Arise, go down upon the camp, for I have given it into your hand.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">But if you fear to go down, go down, you with Purah your lad to the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And you will hear what they speak, and afterward your hands will be strengthened, and you will go down upon the camp." And he went down with Purah his lad to the edge of the armed men that were in the camp.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all those of the East camped in the valley, as numerous as locusts; their camels without numbers; as numerous as the sand which is upon the seashore.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Gideon came, and behold, a man was telling his fellow a dream. And he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a roasted cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent, and smote it, and it fell; and it turned it upside down, and the tent fell."</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And his fellow answered and said, "This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, the man of Israel; God has given Midian, and all the camp into his hand."</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Now when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down. And he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, "Arise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Midian into your hands."</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and gave trumpets into the hands of all of them, and empty pitchers with torches inside the pitchers.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he said to them, "You shall look at me and do likewise. Now behold, when I come to the edge of the camp, then it shall be that as I do, so shall you do.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">When I shall blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then you too blow the trumpets on every side of all the camp, and say, 'For the Lord and for Gideon.' "</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now Gideon came with the hundred men that were with him to the edge of the camp, in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but recently awakened the guards; and they blew the trumpets, and they smashed the pitchers that were in their hands.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers; and they held the torches in their left hands, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, "The sword for the Lord and for Gideon."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And every man stood in his place around the camp; and the entire camp ran, and they trumpeted, and fled.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and the Lord set every man's sword against his fellow, and throughout the whole camp. And the camp fled until Bet Hashittah to Zreira as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And there gathered the men of Israel out of Naphtali, and of Asher, and of all Menasseh, and they pursued Midian.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountain of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against Midian, and seize before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and (also) the Jordan." And all the men of Ephraim gathered, and they seized the waters as far as Beth- barah, and the Jordan.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they captured two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb; and they pursued Midian, and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they brought to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="8"><pasuk id="1">And the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this thing that you have done to us; not to call us, when you went to fight with Midian?" And they quarelled with him vehemently.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Into your hands has God given the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger was abated toward him, when he said this thing.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And Gideon came to the Jordan; he crossed, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint and (yet) pursuing.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he said to the men of Succoth, "Give now loaves of bread to the people that follow me, for they are faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the officials of Succoth said, "Is the palm of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give your army bread?"</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And Gideon said, "Therefore when the Lord delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will thresh your flesh (with) the thorns of the wilderness and with the briers."</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And when he went up from there to Penuel, and he spoke to them in a like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">And he said also to the men of Penuel, saying, "When I come back in peace, I will break down this tower."</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand (men), all that were left of all the camp of the children of the east; for they that fell were a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he smote the camp, for the camp was secure.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and all the camp he terrified.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle when the sun was still high.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And he caught a youth of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he wrote down for him the officials of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And he came to the men of Succoth, and he said, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna (about) whom you did taunt me, saying, 'Is the palm of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give to your tired men bread?"</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and the briers, and with them he broke the men of Succoth.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And he said to Zebah and to Zalmunna, "Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor?" And they said, "As you are, so were they; one was as the form of the children of the king."</pasuk><pasuk id="19">And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the Lord lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you."</pasuk><pasuk id="20">And he said to Jether, his first born, "Stand up, (and) kill them." But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still young.</pasuk><pasuk id="21">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "You stand up and kill us; for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose, and he killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you, and your son, also your son's son; for you have saved us from the hand of Midian."</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And Gideon said to them, "I shall not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you."</pasuk><pasuk id="24">And Gideon said to them, "I would make a request of you, that you give me, every man, the nose-ring of his spoil." For they had golden nose-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And they said, "We shall willingly give." And they spread out the garment, and every man threw therein the nose-ring of his spoil.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And the weight of the golden nose-rings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred (dinars of) gold, beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple garments that were on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were on the necks of their camels.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And Gideon made it into an Ephod, and he set it up in his city, in Ophrah; and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare to Gideon and to his house.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">Now Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they did not continue to raise their heads. And the land rested forty years in the days of Gideon.</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his house.</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And Gideon had seventy sons, who came forth from his thigh; for he had many wives.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And his concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son. And he designated his name Abimelech.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and he was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And it was, when Gideon died, that the children of Israel turned again astray after the Baalim; and they made for themselves Baal-berith for a god.</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And the children of Israel did not remember the Lord their God, who had saved them from the hand of all their enemies around.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And they did not do kindness with the house of Jerubbaal, (who was) Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had done to Israel.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="9"><pasuk id="1">And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers; and he spoke to them, and to all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">"Speak now, in the ears of all the men of Shechem; What is better for you, that there rule over you seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, or that one man rule over you? Now remember that I am your bone and flesh."</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And his mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. And their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And they gave him seventy pieces of silver of the house of Baal-berith. And Abimelech hired with them idle and hasty men, and they followed him.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And he went to his father's house, to Ophrah, and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And all the inhabitants of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of stones that was in Shechem.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">And they told it to Jotham, and he went and stood on the peak of Mount Gerizim, and he raised his voice, and called; and he said to them, "Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">The trees went forth to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'</pasuk><pasuk id="9">But the olive tree said to them, 'Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and men, and go to wave over the trees?'</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And the trees said to the fig tree, 'Go you, and reign over us.'</pasuk><pasuk id="11">But the fig tree said to them, 'Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruitage, and go to wave over the trees?'</pasuk><pasuk id="12">And the trees said to the vine, 'Go you and reign over us.'</pasuk><pasuk id="13">And the vine said to them, 'Should I leave my wine, which causes God and men to rejoice, and go to wave over the trees? '</pasuk><pasuk id="14">Then all the trees said to the thorn, 'Come you, and reign over us.'</pasuk><pasuk id="15">And the thorn said to the trees, 'If in truth you anoint me king over you, (then) come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the thorn, and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'</pasuk><pasuk id="16">And now, if you have dealt in truth and with sincerity, in that you have made Abimelech king, and you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and you have done to him according to the deserts of his hands.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For my father fought for you, and cast his life aside, and saved you from the hand of Midian.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">And you have risen up against my father's house this day, and have killed his sons, seventy men upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid servant, king over the inhabitants of Shechem, because he is your brother.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Now if you have dealt in truth and with sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice with Abimelech and let him also rejoice with you.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and consume the inhabitants of Shechem, and Beth-millo. And let fire come out from the inhabitants of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech."</pasuk><pasuk id="21">And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer; and he dwelt there because of Abimelech his brother.</pasuk><pasuk id="22">And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.</pasuk><pasuk id="23">And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Shechem. And the inhabitants of Shechem betrayed Abimelech.</pasuk><pasuk id="24">That (there) might come the injustice done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, and their blood (which he shed, now) to be placed upon Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and upon the inhabitants of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.</pasuk><pasuk id="25">And the inhabitants of Shechem set for him liers-in-wait on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that passed by them on the way; and it was told to Abimelech.</pasuk><pasuk id="26">And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and they entered Shechem, and the inhabitants of Shechem put their trust in him.</pasuk><pasuk id="27">And they went out into the field, and gathered (the grapes of) their vineyards and trod (them), and made dances. And they came into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.</pasuk><pasuk id="28">And Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we should serve him? Is (he) not the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul (is he not) his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him?</pasuk><pasuk id="29">And would that these people were under my hand, then I would remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, "Increase your army, and come out."</pasuk><pasuk id="30">And Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, and his anger was kindled.</pasuk><pasuk id="31">And he sent messengers to Abimelech in secret, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers are coming to Shechem; and behold, they besiege the city on account of you.</pasuk><pasuk id="32">And now, get up at night, you and the people that are with you, and lie in wait in the field.</pasuk><pasuk id="33">And it shall be, in the morning, as soon as the sun is shining, you shall rise early, and spread out upon the city; and behold, (when) he and the people that are with him come out against you, then you shall do to him whatever you can."</pasuk><pasuk id="34">And Abimelech, and all the people that were with him got up at night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.</pasuk><pasuk id="35">And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimelech and the people that were with him got up from the ambush.</pasuk><pasuk id="36">And Gaal saw the people, and said to Zebul, "Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." And Zebul said to him, "You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."</pasuk><pasuk id="37">And Gaal continued to speak, and said, "Behold, people are coming down from the navel of the earth; and one company is coming, by way of the plain Meonenim."</pasuk><pasuk id="38">And Zebul said to him, "Where then is your mouth, that you used to say, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is not this the people that you have despised? Go out now, and fight with them."</pasuk><pasuk id="39">And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</pasuk><pasuk id="40">And Abimelech pursued him, and he fled before him. And many casualties fell, (even) until the entrance of the gate.</pasuk><pasuk id="41">And Abimelech dwelt in Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers from dwelling in Shechem.</pasuk><pasuk id="42">And it was on the morrow, that the people went out to the field; and they told Abimelech.</pasuk><pasuk id="43">And he took the people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he saw, and behold, the people were coming out of the city; and he rose up against them, and struck them.</pasuk><pasuk id="44">And Abimelech and the companies that were with him, spread out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And the two companies spread out upon all that were in the field, and killed them.</pasuk><pasuk id="45">And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he captured the city, and killed the people that were therein. And he broke down the city, and sowed it with salt.</pasuk><pasuk id="46">And all the inhabitants of the tower of Shechem heard, and they came to the forest of Beth El Brith.</pasuk><pasuk id="47">And it was told to Abimelech that all the inhabitants of the tower of Shechem had gathered.</pasuk><pasuk id="48">And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him: and Abimelech took the axes in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, lifted it, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people that were with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do like me."</pasuk><pasuk id="49">And all the people also cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them nearby the forest, and set the forest on fire upon them; so that also all the men of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.</pasuk><pasuk id="50">And Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped in Thebez and captured it.</pasuk><pasuk id="51">Now there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and the women, and all the inhabitants of the city fled there, and shut themselves in. And they went up to the roof of the tower.</pasuk><pasuk id="52">And Abimelech came up to the tower, and fought against it. And he went close to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</pasuk><pasuk id="53">And a certain woman cast a piece of an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and crushed his skull.</pasuk><pasuk id="54">And he called hastily to the young man, his weapon bearer, and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, 'A woman killed him.' " And his young man pierced him, and he died.</pasuk><pasuk id="55">Now the men of Israel saw that Abimelech had died; and they departed, every man to his place.</pasuk><pasuk id="56">Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers.</pasuk><pasuk id="57">And all the wickedness of the men of Shechem, God requited upon their heads; and there came upon them the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="10"><pasuk id="1">And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir, in the mountain of Ephraim.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And he judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died, and was buried in Shamir.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty white colts, and they had thirty cities; they called them "The Villages of Jair" until this day, which are in the land of Gilead.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">And the children of Israel continued to do that which displeased the Lord, and they served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines.
