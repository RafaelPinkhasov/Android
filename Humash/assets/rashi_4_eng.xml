      <text title="The Lord spoke... in the Sinai Desert... on the first of the month : ">Because they were dear to Him, He counted them often. When they left Egypt, He counted them (Exod. 12:37); when [many] fell because [of the sin] of the golden calf, He counted them to know the number of the survivors (Exod. 32:28); when He came to cause His Divine Presence to rest among them, He counted them. On the first of Nissan, the Mishkan was erected, and on the first of Iyar, He counted them.</text>

      <text title="Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number: ">The legion of the king deserves to be counted on its own (Tanchuma). Another explanation: The Holy One, Blessed Be He, foresaw that a decree was destined to be enacted against all those counted from twenty years and upward [condemning them] to die in the desert. He said,“Let these not be included, for they are Mine, since they did not err in [the sin of] the [golden] calf.” - [B.B. 121]</text>

The color of each one was like the hue of its stone, set in the choshen [worn by the Kohen Gadol], and in this way, everyone could recognize his division. Another explanation: “with the signs [the literal translation of בְאֹתֹת] of his fathers’ house”—according to the sign their father Jacob gave them when they carried him out of Egypt, as it says, “His sons did for him just as he had commanded them” (Gen. 50:12), [which was that] Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun should bear him [his body] from the east, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad from the south etc. as it states in the [Midrash] Tanchuma on this section. — [Rashi]</text>
      <text title="some distance: ">At a distance of a mil, as it is stated in Joshua (3:4),“However, there shall be some distance between you and it; about two thousand cubits.” [The reason for this distance, which is the distance permitted to travel on a Sabbath day, was] so that they would be able to come [to the Mishkan] on the Sabbath, [for] Moses, Aaron and his sons, and the Levites were encamped close to it.</text>

The term יָד does not depart from its usual meaning; the direction of his side is called עַל יָדוֹ, that which is by his hand, closest to him and within reach of his hand; en son aise in Old French. [According to Greenberg, on his place, i.e., the place adjacent to him. According to Gukovitski, at his ease (i.e., within easy reach). According to Berliner, on his side.]</text>

      <text title="These are the descendants of Moses and Aaron: ">Yet only the sons of Aaron are mentioned. However, they are considered descendants of Moses because he taught them Torah.

I gained My right to them through the [Israelite] firstborns, taking them [the Levites] in their place.

Judah the son of R. Shalom said: That tribe is accustomed to being counted from the womb, as it says, “whom she bore to Levi in Egypt” ; as she entered the gate of Egypt, she bore her [Jochebed], yet she [Jochebed] was counted as one of the seventy souls.

      <text title="Moses, Aaron and his sons: ">Near them was the division of the camp of Judah, next to whom camped Issachar and Zebulun. It is good for the righteous, and it is good for his neighbor; because they were neighbors of Moses, who was engaged in Torah study, they became great Torah scholars, as it says, “Judah is my lawgiver” (Ps. 60:9). The descendants of Issachar were those “who had understanding of the times” (I Chron. 12:32)… the two hundred heads of the Sanhedrin,“and from Zebulun came those who wield the scribe’s quill” (Jud. 5:14).

Why were they not included with the rest to redeem the firstborn, thus exempting the two hundred and seventy-three firstborns who were in excess [of the number of Levites] from redemption (see verses 46-48)? Our Sages in Tractate Bechorot (5a) answer that those three hundred Levites were firstborns, and it was enough that they exempt themselves from redemption.</text>

If I tell a firstborn to give five shekels, he will tell me, 'I am one of those redeemed by the Levites.’” What did he do? He brought twenty-two thousand slips [of paper] and wrote on them, “Levite.” [Then] two hundred and seventy-three slips and wrote on them, “five shekels.” He jumbled them and put them into an urn and told them,“Come and take your slips according to lot.” [Sanh. 17a]</text>

Anyone afflicted with tzara’ath was expelled from all [three] of them. One with a discharge was allowed into the Israelite camp, but banned from the [other] two.

[Since only one reference reads שְׁחִיק טַמְיָא, while the others שְׁחִיק עֲצָמוֹת, I believe that Rashi means that there are many places in Gen.

The first is that it is written: “they shall confess,” which teaches us that he [the thief] is not required to pay a fifth and [bring] a guilt [offering] when incriminated by two witnesses, until he admits to the deed himself, and the second [matter] is that what is stolen from a proselyte must be given to the kohanim. - [Sifrei Naso 1:13]</text>

They [the Sages] deduced many other expository explanations from it [this clause] in the Sifrei (Naso 1:31-34). An Aggadic interpretation: “Everyone’s holy things belong to him” [means,] if one withholds his tithes and does not give them [to the kohen or Levite], those tithes shall be his, for eventually his field will produce only a tenth of its usual yield. — [See Midrash Tanchuma , R’eh 10, Pesikta d’Rav Kahana p. 96a, Tos.

Similarly, we find with David, that since he devoted himself to the building of the Temple, as it says, “O Lord, remember for David all his affliction, that he swore to the Lord…” (Ps. 132:1-2), therefore, it [the Temple] was called by his name, as it says, “See your House, David” (I Kings 12:16). - [See Midrash Tanchuma Naso 21]</text>

Three wavings are mentioned in this section: the first (verse 11) refers to the sons of Kohath, and for this reason it states with regard to them, “that they may serve in the Lord’s service,” since they were responsible for the work involving the most holy objects-the ark, the table, etc. The second (verse 13) refers to the sons of Gershon. Therefore, it is stated with regard to them,“a waving before the Lord” (verse 13), for even they were assigned holy work-the curtains and the clasps, which could be seen in the Holy of Holies.

      <text title="oil cakes: ">Heb. לְשֶׁד הַשָּׁמֶן, the moisture of oil. This is how Donash (Teshuvoth Donash p. 14) explains it. Similar to this is:“ My freshness (לְשַׁדִּי) was transformed as in the droughts of summer” (Ps. 32: 4), in which the“lamed” [of לְשַׁדִּי] is part of the root, [meaning]“My freshness (לְשַׁדִּי) was transformed as in the droughts of summer.” [First edition of Rashi reads: and he (Donash) compares to this… (See Yosef Hallel).] Our Sages (Sifrei Beha’alothecha 1:42:8), however, explained it as a term meaning“breasts” (שָׁדַיִם), but what have breasts to do with oil? It is impossible to say that לְשֶׁד הַשָּׁמֶן is related to the expression וַיִשְׁמַן יְשֻׁרוּן, “Jeshurun grew fat” (Deut. 32:15) [and thus, the meaning would be “the taste of a fat breast”], for if that were the case, the“mem” [in the word הַשָּׁמֶן] would be vowelized with a minor “kamatz” [known as “tzeireh”], and the accent would be at the end of the word, under the“mem,” [reading הַשָּׁמֶן]. Now, however, that the “mem” is vowelized with a minor “pathach” [known as “segol”] and the accent is under the “shin,” it means “oil.” The “shin” is vowelized with a major“kamatz” הַשָּׁמֶן and not with a minor“pathach” הַשֶּׁמֶן because it is the last word in a verse. Another interpretation: לְשַׁד is an acronym standing for לִישׁ שֶׁמֶן דְּבַשׁ, kneaded with oil and honey, like a dough kneaded with oil and coated with honey. The rendering of Onkelos who renders: דְּלִישׁ בְּמִשְׁחָא, kneaded with oil , which leans toward the interpretation offered by Donash, since dough kneaded with oil contains the moisture of oil.</text>

The clause, וּמָצָא לָהֶם means, “Would it suffice for them?” This is similar to [the clause,]“and he has sufficient means (וּמָצָא) for redeeming it” (Lev. 25:26). Which [case] is worse? This one, or [when Moses said] “Listen now, you rebels” (20:10)? [Obviously, this one.] However, since [in this case] he [Moses] did not say it in public, Scripture spares him, and refrains from punishing him. But that of Meribah was in public, so Scripture does not spare him. R. Simeon says, God forbid! This never entered the mind of that righteous man. Would the one about whom it says, “he is trusted throughout My house” (12:7) suggest that the Omnipresent cannot provide for us sufficiently? Rather, this is what he meant: “Six hundred thousand… on foot… and You say, 'I will give them meat for a full month’? Then You will kill such a great nation? Will sheep and cattle be slaughtered for them so that they should then be killed, and this meal will satisfy for them forever [i.e., it will be their last]? Is this a credit for you?

Moses went to appease them. He said to them, “Is there a limit to God’s power?

You should have said, “The King does not love him for nothing.” If you claim that I am unaware of his actions, this [statement] is worse than your previous one. — [Sifrei Beha’alothecha 1:42:8, Tanchuma Tzav 13]</text>

They sinned at the cost of their lives, as it says, “the censers of these who sinned at the cost of their lives” (17:3). But what did Korah, who was astute, see [to commit] this folly? His vision deceived him. He saw [prophetically] a chain of great people descended from him: Samuel, who is equal [in importance] to Moses and Aaron. He [Korah] said, “ For his sake I will be spared. [He also saw] twenty-four watches [of Levites] emanating from his grandsons, all prophesying through the holy spirit, as it says, ”all these were the sons of Heman“ (I Chron 25:5). He said, ” Is it possible that all this greatness is destined to emanate from me, and I should remain silent?“ Therefore, he participated [in the rebellion] to reach that prerogative, for he had heard from Moses that they would all perish and one would escape [death]: ”the one whom the Lord chooses-he is the holy one.“ He erred in thinking that it referred to him.

If you do not believe [me], the Holy One, blessed is He, and Moses are at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting; come with me and ask.” This is the meaning of the statement, “Aaron returned to Moses” (Mid.

Because the Israelites were slandering and vilifying the incense, saying that it was a deadly poison; through it Nadab and Abihu died; through it two hundred and fifty people were burnt.

      <text title="Then their complaints will end: ">[The word] וּתְכַל is equivalent to וְתִכְלֶה. The term תְּלוּנֹּתָם is a singular feminine verbal noun, similar to תְּלוּנָּתָם (their complaint), in French, murmures, murmurings. There is a distinction between תְּלוּנָּתָם and תְּלוּנּוֹתָם, the former being a single complaint and the latter a singular noun [collective], even when there are many complaints. (FOOTNOTE: The word וּתְכַל can possibly be used as a transitive verb in the second person singular, masculine gender [you shall end], or as an intransitive verb in the third person singular, feminine gender [she/it shall end]. Therefore, Rashi first establishes that וּתְכַל is equivalent to וְתִכְלֶה, intransitive, here meaning, it [the complaint] shall end, for if it were transitive, referring to Moses [and you, Moses, shall end] it would be vowelized as וּתְכַלֶּה uthechaleh. Having clarified that point, Rashi now explains that it should have said וְתִכְלֶינֶה [in the plural] rather than וּתְכַל, equivalent to וְתִכְלֶה [in the singular], since it refers to תְּלוּנּוֹת, which is plural, and therefore the verb וּתְכַל should conform with it and likewise be in the plural.

And there are many other instances [of the word אִם] in this sense, [as in]“that (אִם) his days are limited” (ibid. 14:5).</text>

But Israel saw that they were dressed like Amalekites though they spoke in a Canaanite tongue. So they said, “We will pray generally [for success],” as it says, “If You deliver his people into my hand….” - [Midrash Aggadah , Yalkut Shimoni from Midrash Yelammedenu .

Here they went back seven stations, as it says, “The children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Benei Yaakan to Moserah; there Aaron died” (ibid. 10:6). Did he really die in Moserah? Did he not die at Mount Hor? However, there [in Moserah] they again mourned for him and eulogized him, as if he had died in their presence. Go and study the stations, and you will find that there were seven stations between Moserah and Mount Hor. — [Midrash Tanchuma Chukkath 18, Seder Olam ch. 9]</text>
      <text title="to circle the land of Edom: ">since they did not allow them to pass through their land.</text>
      <text title="and the people became disheartened because of the way: ">Because of the hardship of traveling, which was hard for them. They said, “Now we were so close to entering the Land, and we are turning back. So did our fathers turn back and remain for thirty-eight years, until today.” Therefore, they became disheartened by the hardship of traveling. In old French, encrote lor , or encrut lor, it discouraged them. It is, however, incorrect to say that the people became disheartened בַּדָּרֶךְ, meaning “while on the way,” without explaining what caused them to become disheartened, for whenever קִצּוּר נֶפֶשׁ [literally, shortness of spirit] is mentioned in Scripture, the cause of the discouragement is specified, as in, “I could not tolerate them (וַתִּקְצַר נַפְשִׁי בָּהֶם)” (Zech. 11:8), and as in, “He felt distressed because of the misery of Israel (וַתִּקְצַר נַפְשׁוֹ בַּעֲמַל יִשְׂרָאֵל)” (Jud. 10:16). Anything difficult for a person to bear is called קִצּוּר נֶפֶשׁ, like a person who is beset with trouble, and his mind is not composed enough to accept it. There is no place in his heart for the distress to settle. The thing causing the distress is described as ‘large’ since it is too large for him and weighs heavily on him, as in, “and their souls also loathed Me (בָּחֲלָה בִי)” (Zech. 11:8); they were too much for Me. [And also,] “And it is so great (וְיִגְאֶה) that you hunt me like a lion” (Job 10:16). In summary, the expression shortness of spirit (קִצּוּר נֶפֶשׁ) for a thing, means that it is intolerable, and the mind cannot bear it.</text>

A road passed along [the floor of] the gorge. The Amorites said, “When the Israelites enter the land by passing through the gorge, we will come out of the caves in the mountains above them and kill them with arrows and stones shot from catapults.” There were clefts in the rock on the Moabite side [of the canyon], and directly opposite those clefts, on the mountain on the Amorite side, there were protrusions, [appearing] like horns and breasts. When the Israelites prepared to pass through, the mountain of the Land of Israel trembled, like a maidservant going out to greet her mistress, and moved toward the mountain of Moab. Then those breastlike protrusions entered the clefts, killing them [the Amorites]. This is the meaning of, “that turned to settle at Ar.” The mountain swung from its place and moved toward the side of the Moabite border, and attached itself to it.

The verse is elliptical [as it should read בַּעַל הַדֶּר‏ֶ, the one embarking on the journey]. Similar is וַתְּכַל דָּוִד“David longed” (II Sam. 13:39), which means וַתְּכַל נֶפֶשׁ דָּוִד,“David’s soul longed,” [as is apparent from the feminine prefix of the verb וַתְּכַל.

      <text title="from Zerah: ">This was Zohar [see Exod. 6:15], a name derived from the word צֹהַר, which means shining [a synonym of זֶרַח, Zerah]. However, the family of Ohad [mentioned in Exodus] died out, as did five from the tribe of Benjamin. For he came to Egypt with ten sons, but only five are listed here. So it was with Ezbon of the tribe of Gad, so [altogether] seven families [no longer existed]. I found [the reason for this] in the Talmud Yerushlmi [Sotah 1:1]. When Aaron died, the clouds of glory withdrew, and the Canaanites came to fight against Israel. They [the Israelites] set their hearts on returning to Egypt, and they went back eight stages of their journey [compare 21:4], from Mount Hor to Moserah, as it says, “The children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Benei Yaakan to Moserah; there Aaron died” (Deut. 10:6). Now did he not die at Mount Hor? And [furthermore,] going back from Moserah to Mount Hor there are eight stages in the journey! However, they turned back, and the Levites pursued them to bring them back, killing seven of their families. The Levites lost four families [in the battle]: the families of the Shimeites and the Uzzielites, and of the three sons of Izhar, only the family of the Korahites is mentioned. I do not know [the identity of] the fourth one. R. Tanchuma expounds that they [the seven Israelite families] fell in the plague in connection with Balaam [see 25:9] (Mid. Tanchuma Pinchas 5), but [this cannot be, for] according to the number missing from the tribe of Simeon in this census compared with the first census [which took place] in the Sinai desert, it would appear that all twenty-four thousand who fell [in the plague] were from the tribe of Simeon. - [Mid.

I found in the writings of R. Moshe Hadarshan [the preacher], that their [Ard and Naaman’s] mother migrated to Egypt while she was pregnant with them, and that is why they formed separate families just as did Hezron and Hamul-who were Judah’s grandsons-and Heber and Malchiel, who were Asher’s grandchildren. If this is an Aggadah, all well and good, [we must accept it,] but if not, I maintain that Bela had numerous grandchildren, and from two of them-Ard and Naaman-two large families issued, and the descendants of all the other children were called after Bela’s name, whereas the descendants of these two were called after them [i.e. Ard and Naaman]. Similarly, I maintain that the sons of Machir were divided into two families, one was called after him and one was called after his son Gilead. Five families are missing from the sons of Benjamin, and here the prophecy of his mother [Rachel] was partially fulfilled. She called him Ben Oni, the son of my mourning.

Since some areas were superior to others, the Land was not divided [solely] according to measurements, but it was assessed; an inferior piece of land sufficient to sow a kor was equivalent to a superior piece sufficient to sow a seah [a thirtieth of a kor]; it all depended on the value [of the soil]. — [Sifrei Pinchas 7]</text>

Two brothers who came out of Egypt who had sons that entered the Land-one had one [son] and the other had three. The one received one portion, and the three received three, as it says, “You shall apportion the Land among these” (verse 53). The inheritance [of these four] reverts to their grandfather [who left Egypt] and they divided everything equally. This is the meaning of what is stated,“they shall inherit it according to the names of their fathers’ tribes.” For after the sons received it, it was divided up according to the fathers who had left Egypt, whereas had they apportioned it originally according to the number who came out of Egypt, these four would not have received four but only two portions.

Perhaps the decree has been annulled, and I will enter the Land?” The Holy One, blessed is He, said to him, “My decree remains as it was” (Mid. Tanchuma Pinchas 9). Another interpretation: Since Moses had entered the territories of the descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben, he rejoiced, saying, “It seems that the vow [made] regarding me has been annulled.” This can be compared to a king who decreed that his son could not enter the portals of his palace. He [the king] entered the gate, with him [the son] following; the courtyard, with him following; the foyer with him following.

On each occasion that their death is mentioned, their sin is mentioned, for a decree had been pronounced against the generation of the desert, that they should die in the desert on account of their sin that they did not believe. Moses therefore requested that his sin be mentioned, so that it should not be said that he was one of those who rebelled. This is analogous to two women who were flogged by the court, one for immoral behavior [adultery] and the other for eating unripe produce of the sabbatical year [a lighter offense]….

      <text title="These are the journeys: ">Why were these journeys recorded? To inform us of the kind deeds of the Omnipresent, for although He issued a decree to move them around [from place to place] and make them wander in the desert, you should not say that they were moving about and wandering from station to station for all forty years, and they had no rest, because there are only forty-two stages. Deduct fourteen of them, for they all took place in the first year, before the decree, from when they journeyed from Rameses until they arrived in Rithmah, from where the spies were sent, as it says, “Then the people journeyed from Hazeroth [and camped in the desert of Paran].” (12:16); “Send out for yourself men…” (13:2), and here it says, “They journeyed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah,” teaching us that it [Rithmah] was in the desert of Paran. Subtract a further eight stages which took place after Aaron’s death-from Mount Hor to the plains of Moab-during the fortieth year, and you will find that throughout the thirty-eight years they made only twenty journeys. I found this in the commentary of R. Moshe (Hadarshan) [the preacher] (Mid. Aggadah). R. Tanchuma expounds it in another way. It is analogous to a king whose son became sick, so he took him to a far away place to have him healed. On the way back, the father began citing all the stages of their journey, saying to him, “This is where we sat, here we were cold, here you had a headache etc.” - [Mid. Tanchuma Massei 3, Num.

      <text title="Your southernmost corner shall be: ">The southern flank extending from east to west.</text>
      <text title="from the desert of Zin: ">which adjoins Edom, beginning in the southeastern corner of the land of the nine tribes. How? Three lands lie south of the Land of Israel, each adjoining the other-part of Egypt, the entire land of Edom, and the entire land of Moab. The land of Egypt is in the southwestern corner, as it says [later] in this passage, “from Azmon to the stream of Egypt and its ends shall be to the sea” (verse 5). The stream of Egypt ran through the entire length of Egypt, as it says, “from the Shihor [river], which is along the face of Egypt” (Josh. 13:3), and it intervenes between the land of Egypt from the Land of Israel. The land of Edom adjoins it [Egypt] from the east, and the land of Moab adjoins the land of Edom at the southeastern corner [of the land of Israel]. When the Israelites departed from Egypt, had the Omnipresent wished to expedite their entry into the Land, He would have taken them northward across the Nile, and they would have thus entered the Land. But He did not do so, and this is the meaning of what is said, “God did not lead them [by] way of the land of the Philistines” (Exod. 13:17). For they [the Philistines] dwelt by the sea in the west of the land of Canaan, as it says regarding the Philistines, “those who inhabit the coastal area, the Cherethite nation” (Zeph. 2:5). He did not lead them by that route, but diverted them and took them along the southern route, to the desert. Ezekiel called it “the desert of the nations” (Ezek. 5:35) because several nations dwelt alongside it. He led them along the south, always from west to east, until they arrived at the southern end of the land of Edom. They asked the king of Edom for permission to enter his land and traverse its width in order to enter the Land [of Israel], but he refused, and they had to turn and travel along the entire south of Edom until they reached the southern end of the land of Moab, as it says, “He sent [messengers] also to the king of Moab, but he was unwilling” (Jud. 11:17). They then traversed the entire southern boundary of Moab, right to the end, and then turned northward until they had passed along its entire eastern boundary, along its width, and when they finished its eastern boundary, they came upon the land of Sihon and Og, who dwelt to the east of the land of Canaan, with the Jordan [river] intervening between them. This is the meaning of what is stated concerning Jephthah,“And they went through the desert and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and they came to the east of the land of Moab” (ibid. 18). They conquered the lands of Sihon and Og, which were to the north of Moab, and came near to the Jordan, opposite the northwestern corner of the land of Moab. Hence, the land of Canaan, which was across the Jordan to the west, has its southeastern corner bordering on Edom.</text>
