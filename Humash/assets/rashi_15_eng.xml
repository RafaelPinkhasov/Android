      <text title="The word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, etc.: ">He buried these four kings during his lifetime, for he outlived them all. From here they derived the maxim: Woe is to authority, for it buries its holders [from Pesachim 87b].</text>
      <text title="and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash: ">He was of the sons of Jehu [i.e., a great grandson of Jehu], and he too reigned with Uzziah and Jotham, but a meritorious deed caused him to be counted with these righteous men, since he did not heed slander concerning Amos, as is explained in Pesachim, in the chapter entitled הָאִשָּׁה, “The woman” (87b), as it is stated: “(Amos 7:10) And Amaziah sent etc. ‘Amos has conspired against you etc.’”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="At the beginning of the Lord’s speaking to Hosea: ">Lit. in the beginning the Lord spoke to Hosea. Therefore, our Rabbis stated: The first of the four prophets who prophesied (in these days): Hosea, Isaiah, Amos, and Micah. [Parshandatha reads: in the days of Uzziah. Michah, in fact, is not mentioned as having prophesized in the days of Uzziah, but only in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah; this will be explained further. In Pesachim 87a, we read: at that time] Isaiah prophesized [at the time of the earthquake (Parshandatha)], as it is stated: (Isaiah 6:4) “And the doorposts quaked etc.” And that was the day that Uzziah was stricken when he entered the Temple, for the ethereal beings clamored to burn him, and the earthly beings to swallow him as the punishment of Korah’s company, among which there were [some] swallowed up and [some] burned. Concerning Amos, it is stated: (Amos 1:1) “Two years before the earthquake.” [Amos, accordingly, preceded Isaiah.] And Micah was the last of all of them, for it is said concerning him: (Micah 1:1) “In the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,” and Uzziah is not mentioned in his regard (Cf. Pesachim 87a; Seder Olam, ch. 20; Tanhuma Tzav 13; Rashi, Isaiah 6:4). But the simple meaning of the verse is: At the beginning of the speech which the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to Hosea, he said this to him.</text>
      <text title="take yourself a wife of harlotry: ">Our Rabbis said: This is to be explained according to its apparent meaning: Since he said about Israel, “Exchange them for another nation,” as is explained in Pesachim at the beginning of the chapter entitled האשה, “The woman” (87a).</text>
      <text title="and children of harlotry: ">For she will bear you children who will be of possible illegitimacy. And Jonathan paraphrased: Prophesy a prophecy about the inhabitants of the cities of idolatry. The word קַח, stated here is an expression of teaching, [derived from לֶקַח, doctrine]. Teach them to repent.</text>
      <text title="goes astray: ">Heb. תִּזְנֶה. This is the present tense.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="Gomer: ">Our Rabbis (Pesachim 87a) said. That was her name by dint of her harlotry, for all would gratify their lust on her (גּוֹמְרִין) and they would tread upon her like a pressed fig (דְּבֵלָה). [That is a euphemism for sexual contact.] Jonathan, however, paraphrases: גֹּמֶר, that if they would return from their way, their retribution would be finished, and if not, they will be like unripe figs falling from the fig tree.</text>
      <text title="and she conceived and bore: ">Jonathan paraphrases: And they continued to do evil deeds.</text>

    <pasuk id="4">
      <text title="Name him Jezreel: ">Jonathan renders: Call their name the scattered ones. I.e. prophesy over them that they will be exiled, and they will be sown among the peoples.</text>
      <text title="the blood of Jezreel: ">To be understood according to its Aramaic translation: the blood of the house of Ahab, whom Jehu slew in Jezreel because they worshipped Baal, and he and his sons went afterwards and worshipped pagan deities; therefore, I account for them the blood of the house of Ahab as innocent blood.</text>
      <text title="upon the house of Jehu: ">Jeroboam the son of Joash was of the sons of Jehu, and his son Zechariah was assassinated.</text>

      <text title="I will not continue to grant clemency Heb.: ">אֲרַחֵם, like לְרַחֵם, to grant clemency.</text>
      <text title="but I will mete out their portion to them: ">I will mete out to them the portion of their cup and their deed. This expression is like (Gen. 43: 34), “And he gave out portions (וַיִּשָּׂא מַשְׂאֹת).”</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="But to the house of Judah will I grant clemency: ">after I terminate the kingdom of Israel, for after the ten tribes were exiled, the house of Judah was the object of clemency from Hezekiah until Zedakiah.</text>

      <text title="And she weaned Lo ruhamah: ">According to the Targum, we explain: And that generation shall perish among the nations where they were exiled.</text>

    <pasuk id="1">
      <text title="And the number… shall be: ">What is the connection of retribution and consolation juxtaposed in one speech? Our Rabbis explained in Pesachim (87b): Hosea felt that he had sinned by saying, “Exchange them for another nation.” He stood and begged mercy for them (See above 1:2). And in Sifrei Devei Rav, in the section commencing: “And Israel abode in Shittim” (Num. 25) we learned: Rabbi says: Some sections are close to each other yet as far apart as east is far from west. “For you are not My people… And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea.” What is the connection of one to the other? This can be compared to a king who became angry with his wife. He summoned a scribe to come and write a bill of divorcement. Before the scribe arrived, the king became reconciled with his wife. Said the king, “Is it possible that this scribe should leave here divided?” I.e. his heart should be divided and bewildered, saying, “Why did the king send for me?” He said to him, “Come and write that I am doubling her kethubah.” And according to its simple meaning, this is the reason for its juxtaposition. “For you are not My people, and I will not be yours.” I will show Myself as though I am not yours, and you shall be exiled among the nations, and even there you shall multiply and grow, and there you shall lay it to your heart to return to Me, as it is said through Moses (Deut. 30:1,3): “And you shall lay it to your heart among all the nations where… has exiled you etc. And the Lord your God shall return your captivity.” Here too, “And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together.”</text>

      <text title="Strive with your mother, strive: ">With your nation of today, which is the mother of future generations.</text>
      <text title="and her adulteries from between her breasts: ">It is customary among the adulteresses that they [i.e., their lovers] squeeze them between their breasts. Jonathan renders: And the worship of idols from among her cities.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="5">
      <text title="as [on] the day she was born: ">Like the day that I found her in Egypt, as is delineated in Ezekiel (16:4, 5): “And as for your birth, on the day you were born your navel was not cut etc. No eye took pity on you etc. with a loathing of your body.”</text>
      <text title="like a desert: ">This alludes to the decrees that I decreed upon you (Parshandatha: them) in the desert, viz. that there they should perish and there they would die (Num. 14:35).</text>
      <text title="and [I will] cause her to die: ">Jonathan renders: And I will kill her.</text>

    <pasuk id="7">
      <text title="their mother: ">Their nation.</text>
      <text title="she who conceived them behaved shamefully: ">Jonathan, who renders: Their teachers are ashamed. The wise men who teach them with instructions are ashamed before the ignorant populace. They tell them, “You shall not steal,” but they steal. “You shall not lend for interest,” but they lend.</text>
      <text title="after my lovers: ">In the ways of the nations.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="8">
      <text title="behold I will close off: ">Heb. שָׂ an expression of closing. Comp. (Isaiah 5: 5) “remove its hedge (מְשׂוּכָּתוֹ) ” ; (Proverbs 15:19) “as though hedged (כִּמְשֻּׂכַת) by thorns.”</text>

      <text title="her lovers: ">Egypt and Assyria, and you will not be able to seek aid from them.</text>
      <text title="And she shall pursue: ">Heb. וְרִדְּפָה This is one of the intensive conjugations. Comp. (Proverbs 12:11) “and he who pursues empty ones” (porcacier in O.F:, poursuivra in modern French), to pursue. I.e. she will follow them and not overtake them.</text>
      <text title="and she shall seek them: ">Heb. וּבִקְשָׁתַם, a combination of אוֹתָם וּבִקְשָׁה.</text>

    <pasuk id="10">
      <text title="But she did not know: ">She did not lay it to her heart, but showed herself as unknowing.</text>

      <text title="and I will separate: ">[Heb. וְהִצַּלְתִּי] from her My wool and My flax, which was to cover her nakedness. Every expression of הָצָלָה in Scripture is an expression of separation and setting apart. Proof of this we find in (Gen. 31: 9) “And God separated (וַיַצֵּל) your father’s cattle,” (ibid.:16) “For all the wealth that… separated (הִצִיל).”</text>

      <text title="and she adorned herself with her earrings and her jewelry: ">Heb. וַתַּעַד, an expression of jewelry (עֲדִי). Like a harlot who adorns herself to greet her paramours. And חֶלְיָתָה is an Arabic term meaning jewelry.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="16">
      <text title="Therefore, behold I will allure her: ">I will persuade her to be drawn after Me (losanjier in O.F., to flatter or cajole). Other editions read: atrayray in O.F. (attirerai). I will lure, attract. And what is the allurement?</text>
      <text title="and lead her into the desert: ">In exile, which is to her like a desert and a wasteland. And there she will lay up to her heart that it was better for her when she performed My will than when she rebelled against Me.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="17">
      <text title="her vineyards: ">Jonathan rendered this as an expression of managers and leaders. Comp. (Job 24:18) “he will not face the way of the vineyards,” meaning that the people of the generation of the flood had made up their mind not to follow the righteous leaders, such as Noah and Methusalah. And so, (Song 1:6) “my vineyard I did not guard.” The allusion is to the worship of idols instead of worshipping God, the Leader. Another explanation:</text>
      <text title="and lead her into the desert: ">To the desert of Sihon and Og, and with the same expression Ezekiel prophesied (20:35, 38), “And I will bring you there to the desert of the peoples, and I will contend with you there, etc. As I continued with your forefathers etc., and I will bring them into the tradition of the covenant. And I will purge you of those who rebel…” but the righteous I will keep alive. That is the intention of “her vineyards.” [from Ruth Rabbah 5:6, Pesikta d’Rav Kahana 49b].</text>
      <text title="and the depth of trouble: ">Heb. עֶמֶק עָכוּר. The depth of the exile where they were troubled I will give her for a door of hope (an expectation of hope), for, out of those troubles, she will take heart to return to Me.</text>
      <text title="and she shall dwell there: ">Heb. וְעָנְתָה, an expression of dwelling. Comp. (Nahum 2:12) “a den (מְעוֹן) of lions.” [from Machbereth Menachem p. 135]</text>
      <text title="as in the days of her youth: ">when she dwelt in Egypt a long time.</text>
      <text title="and as the day of her ascent, etc.: ">as Israel cried out to me in Egypt because of the subjugation and I redeemed her, so also now.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="18">
      <text title="you shall call [Me] Ishi, etc: ">You shall worship Me out of love and not out of fear. Ishi is an expression of marriage and the love of one’s youth.</text>
      <text title="Baali: ">An expression of mastership and fear. And our Rabbis (Pesachim 87a, Kethuboth 71b) explained: Like a bride in her father-in-law’s house, and not like a bride in her father’s house.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="19">
      <text title="and they shall no longer be mentioned: ">I.e. Israel shall no longer be mentioned by the name of the baalim. Or, the baalim shall no longer be mentioned by the name of Israel, saying that they are their gods. Or, the name of the baalim shall no longer be mentioned, as it is stated. (Isa. 2:18) “And the idols shall completely pass away.”</text>

    <pasuk id="20">

      <text title="with righteousness and with justice: ">which you practice.</text>
      <text title="and with loving-kindness and with mercy: ">which will come to you from Me because of them. Concerning our father Abraham, it is written (Gen 18:19): “For I love him since he commands etc. to perform righteousness and justice.” And, corresponding to them, He bestowed upon his children loving-kindness and mercy, as it is said (Deut. 13:18): “And He shall grant you mercy” ; (ibid. 7:12) “And the Lord your God shall keep for you the covenant and the loving- kindness.” When they ceased to perform righteousness and justice, as it is said (Amos 5:7): “Those who turn justice into wormwood, and righteousness they leave on the ground,” also the Holy One, blessed be He, took away from them the loving-kindness and the mercy, as it is said (Jer. 16:5): “for I have gathered in My peace from this people, says the Lord, the loving-kindness and the mercies.” And when they will return to perform righteousness and justice, they shall be redeemed immediately, as it is said (Isa. 1: 27): “Zion shall be redeemed through justice, and her penitent through righteousness.” And the Holy One, blessed be He, will add mercy and loving-kindness to them and make a crown of all four of them and place it on their head.</text>

      <text title="goblets of grapes: ">Heb. אֲשִׁישֵׁי עֲנָבִים. Menahem (Machbereth p. 34) explains. ‘goblets of wine.’ They are fond of becoming drunk with their wine and do not engage in Torah. And so we find that elsewhere he castigates for this: “that drink wine in bowls, etc” (Amos 6:6).</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="2">
      <text title="And I bought her: ">It is an expression of a business transaction, ‘bargaine’ in Old French, similar to “which I have purchased (כָּרִיתִי) for me” (Gen. 50:5). Now in the sea-towns they refer to a sale (Heb. מְכִירָה) as כִּירָה [from Hullin 92a].</text>
      <text title="for fifteen pieces of silver, and a chomer of barley and a lethech of barley: ">Jonathan paraphrases: “And I redeemed them at My command on the fifteenth day of the month of Nisan, and I made shekalim of silver an atonement for their souls, and I declared that they offer before me an ‘omer’ as heave- offering from the barley harvest; that is to say, I did not weary you with difficult duties.”</text>
      <text title="for fifteen pieces of silver: ">It is the numerical equivalent of Nissan. Now in the Pesikta it is expounded: “fifteen pieces of silver,” on the fifteenth day of Nissan. Now a chomer and a lethech total forty-five, for the chomer equals thirty seah, and the lethech is a half-chomer.</text>
    </pasuk>
    <pasuk id="3">
      <text title="and I said to her: You shall remain as mine for many days: ">The plural “days” refers to (a minimum) of two, “many” to (a minimum of) three, making a total of five. This (the forty-five of the previous verse added to the five of this verse) alludes to the fifty days between Passover and Pentecost. On that day I offered her the Torah, admonishing her:</text>
      <text title="you shall not play the harlot and you shall not belong to another man: ">[that is], “You shall have no other gods before Me” (Exodus 20:3); so…</text>
      <text title="will I be towards you: ">“I am the Lord your God” (Ex. 20:2). Now the reason he split the fifty days into separate calculations, one at the conclusion of “chomer” (i.e., 50 days), the other at the conclusion of “lethech” (i.e., the ensuing 15 days), is to represent the “manna” that descended upon them at the culmination of thirty days [from their exodus] on the fifteenth day (sic) of Iyar. From that point, for an [additional] fifteen daysthe numerical equivalent of the number of seah in a lethechon that day they arrived in the Sinai desert on the first day of the month of Sivan. Now in the name of Rav Hai I found a most fitting thing: “So I bought her to me etc.,” (verse 2) I have established her atonement indemnity money as a light sum, for whosoever states: “My valuation is incumbent upon me to contribute to the sanctuary, should he be from the age of sixty and above” his valuation shall be fifteen shekels (Lev. 27:7). This sum of fifteen shekels is, according to this interpretation, symbolized by the fifteen pieces of silver of v. 2): Now the “chomer” of barley [represents] the valuation of a male aged twenty and above until sixty, viz. fifty shekels (see Lev. 27:3), the amount of redemption money of a chomer of barley which is similarly fifty silver shekels (See Lev. 27:16: “And if a man shall dedicate to the Lord some part of his field… the seed of a ” chomer “ of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.”) Now regarding the lethech of barley, the amount for redeeming a field containing a lethech of barley for the sanctuary is twenty-five shekels, which is [equal to the sum of] the valuation of someone from one month up to five years, which equals five shekels (Lev. 27:6), and that of one from five years up to twenty years, in which cases, “the valuation shall be twenty shekels (Lev. 27:5),” totalling twenty-five shekels. After all this display of affection [by allowing for such relatively easy absolution,] I said to her:</text>
      <text title="[3] You shall remain as mine for many days; you shall not play the harlot: ">by turning to other gods, for, if you do play the harlot, your children shall remain for many days…</text>

      <text title="Afterwards: ">Following the days of exile.</text>
      <text title="shall the children of Israel return: ">It was taught in the name of R. Shimon the son of Yochai: The children of Israel rejected three things during the reign of Rehoboam; the Kingdom of Heaven, the kingdom of the House of David, and the Holy Temple, as it is written: “What portion have we in David” (I Kings 12:16) which may be understood literally; “to your tents O’ Israel” (ibid.), do not read, “to your tents” (Heb. לְאֹהָלֶ) but “to your gods” (Heb. לֵאלֹהֶ) “now see your own house, David” (ibid.), refers to the Holy Temple (see Rashi I Kings 12:16). R. Shimon the son of Menassiah said: Israel shall not be shown any omen of good until they repent by seeking out all three; “Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek their Lord their God,” which refers to the Kingdom of Heaven; “and David their king” is self explanatory; “and shall come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness,” which refers to the Holy Temple, as it is written “that good mount” (Deut. 3:7) (a reference to the Temple Mount.

And so did Jonathan render: of the altars of their abominations. Addendum according to Abarbanel: I found a Midrash Tanhuma, where it is an expression of tying, like a man who threatens a person who provokes him, “[I swear] by your life that I will tie it to you at your end.” So does this verse threaten Israel: “My zeal and My fury are tied up to avenge Myself at the end, and they will be ashamed of their deeds.”</text>

The word שַחֲטָה, translated as ‘extent’ is an expression similar to זָהָב שָׁחוּט, “malleable gold” (I Kings 10:16) stretched and spun.

You find that, when the ten tribes were exiled, Benjamin and Judah were not exiled, and the ten tribes were saying, Because they are the dwellers of His palace, He did not exile them. There is favoritism in this matter. God forbid, there is no favoritism, but their measure of sin was not yet full. As soon as they sinned, they were exiled. Then the ten tribes were bewildered, without an answer in their mouths, and they said, “Behold God! Behold the Mighty One! Behold the Just One!

(Gen. 50:18) “And his brothers too wept and fell etc. ‘Behold we are slaves to you etc.’” אוֹן means the laws of a deed. Comp. (Gittin 43b) “They may write his deed (אוֹנוֹ) for it.” Comp. (Gittin 43b) “They may write his deed אוֹנוֹ for it.” Comp. also (Gen. Rabbah 2:2) With one deed (אוֹנוֹ) and with one price. "And this is its explanation:</text>
      <text title="“And Ephraim said: Surely I have become rich; I have found a deed for myself.”: ">Jeroboam son of Nebat, who was of the tribe of Ephraim, boasts and declares: Surely I have become rich, I have found a deed for myself, one deed, that all Israel are my slaves, for my father acquired them, as it is written: And his brothers too went and fell before him, and said: Behold we are your slaves. And whatever a slave acquires belongs to his master. Hence, all their property is mine. Therefore, I have no sin if I take all that is theirs, for they are my slaves. What is written after this? And I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt. The greatness that came to your father in Egypt was from Me. Said the Holy One, blessed be He. ‘Behold we are your slaves,’ you have not forgotten, but ‘I am the Lord your God,’ which was stated in the Decalogue, you have forgotten, for you have erected two calves, one in Bethel and one in Dan. And according to the simple meaning of the verse, you say, “I have found power for myself through oppression and deceitful scales.” And I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt. There I distinguished between a droplet [of seed] of a firstborn and a droplet which was not of a firstborn.

      <text title="shall not suffice: ">Heb. לֹא יִמְצְאוּ, usually translated ‘shall not find.’ They shall not suffice. Comp.

This can be compared to a king against whom a province rebelled. The king sent a general and commanded him to destroy it. That general was expert and deliberate. He said to them, “Take for yourselves days (sic); otherwise, I will do to you as I have done to such-and-such a province and to its allies, and to such-and-such a prefecture and to its allies.” Therefore it says, “Samaria shall be accounted guilty,” and then Scripture says: “Return, O Israel.” As is found in Sifrei in the section commencing. (Num. 25:1), “And Israel abode in Shittim.”</text>
      <text title="to the Lord your God: ">One taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: Return, O Israel, while He is still יהוה, with the Divine Attribute of Mercy; otherwise, He is אֶלֹהֶי with the Divine Attribute of Justice, before the defense becomes the prosecution.

      <text title="You shall forgive all iniquity: ">Heb. כָּל-תִּשָׂא עָוֹן. Forgive all our iniquities.</text>
      <text title="and teach [us the] good [way]: ">Heb. וְקַח-טוֹב. And teach us the good way. Another explanation: The few good deeds in our hands take in Your hand and judge us accordingly. And so does David say (Psalms 17:2): “Let my sentence come forth from before You, may Your eyes behold the right.” Another explanation: And accept good And accept confession from us, as it is said (Psalms 92:2): “It is good to confess to the Lord.”</text>
      <text title="and let us render [for] bulls: ">that we should have sacrificed before you, let us render them with the placation of the words of our lips.</text>

      <text title="Assyria shall not save us: ">Say this also before Him, “We no longer seek the aid of man, neither from Assyria nor from Egypt.”</text>
      <text title="we will not ride on horses: ">This is the aid from Egypt, who would send them horses, as they said to Isaiah (30:16), “No, but on horses will we flee… And on swift steeds will we ride.”</text>
      <text title="nor will we say any longer: ">to the work of our hands that they are our gods.</text>

After they say this before Me, I will remedy their backsliding, and I will love them with My charitable spirit. Although they do not deserve the love, I will love them charitably since My wrath has turned away from them.</text>

      <text title="Those who dwelt in its shade shall return: ">Those who already dwelt in the shade of the Lebanon, to which He compared Israel and the Temple, and now were exiled there from, shall return to it.</text>
      <text title="its fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon: ">Jonathan renders: Like the remembrance of the blasts of the trumpets over the old wine poured for libations in the Temple. For they would blow the trumpets over the libations when the Levites would recite the song.</text>
