<book><chapter id="1"><pasuk id="1">The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet prophesied:</pasuk><pasuk id="2">O Lord! How long will I cry and You will not hear! I cry out to You of violence, and You will not save!</pasuk><pasuk id="3">Why do You show me iniquity and look upon mischief; and plunder and violence are before me; and the one who bears quarrel and strife endures.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Therefore Torah is slackened, and justice does not go out forever, for a wicked man surrounds the righteous; therefore, justice emerges perverted.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">See among the nations, and look, and wonder with amazement, for He is performing a deed in your days. You shall not believe when it is told</pasuk><pasuk id="6">that behold, I am setting up the Chaldeans, the bitter and impetuous nation who shall march through the breadth of the land, to inherit dwellings that are not theirs.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">They are terrible and dreadful; from themselves their judgment and their burden shall emanate.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">And their steeds are swifter than leopards, and they are more fierce than the wolves of the evening; and their riders shall increase and their riders shall come from afar; they shall fly like an eagle that hastens to devour.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">They shall all come to commit violence-the eagerness of their faces is like the east wind, and they have gathered captives like the sand.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">And they shall mock the kings, and princes are a laughingstock for them. He shall scoff at every fortress; he piles up earth and captures it.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">Then a spirit goes further and passes, and they become guilty; this strength they attribute to their god.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Are You not from everlasting, O Lord, my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O Lord, You have ordained them for judgment, and, O Mighty God, You have established them for correction.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">[You are] of eyes too pure to behold evil, and You cannot gaze upon iniquity. Why should You gaze upon traitors, be silent when a wicked man swallows up one more righteous than he?</pasuk><pasuk id="14">And You have made man like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things of the earth over which there is no ruler.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">He takes all of them up with the fishhook, he catches them in his net and gathers them in his trawl. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and he burns incense to his trawl, for through them his portion is fat and his food is a fatling.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">Is it because of this that he empties his net and continually [does] not spare to slay nations?</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="2"><pasuk id="1">On my watch I will stand, and I will set myself upon a fortress, and I will look out to see what He will speak to me and what I will reply when I am reproved.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">And the Lord answered me and said: Write the vision and explain it upon the tablets, so that one may read it swiftly.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">For there shall be another vision for the appointed time; and He shall speak of the end, and it shall not fail; though it tarry, wait for it, for it shall surely come; it shall not delay.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">Behold, it is puffed up-his soul is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">And surely he, whom wine betrays, a haughty man whose dwelling shall not remain, who widened his desire like the nether- world-and he is like death and shall never be sated, and he gathered all the nations to himself and collected to himself all peoples.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">Shall not all these take up a parable against him and a figure of a riddle against him? And he shall say, "Woe to him who increases what is not his! How long? And who loads himself with a beam of mud!"</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Will not those who bite you arise suddenly, and those who startle you awaken? And you shall become plunder for them.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Since you have cast away many nations, all remaining peoples shall cast you away, because of the blood of man and the violence done to the land, the city, and all its inhabitants.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Woe to him who gains evil gains for his house to place his nest on high, to be saved from the hand of an evil one.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">You have advised shame for your house, to cut off many peoples, and you have sinned against your life.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">For a stone shall cry from the wall, and a chip shall answer it from a beam.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">Woe to him who builds a city with blood and establishes a city with injustice.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">Behold, is it not from the Lord of Hosts? And peoples shall toil until they are sated with fire, and nations shall weary themselves only for vanity.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord-as the water covers the seabed.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">Woe to him who gives his friend to drink, who adds Your venom and also makes him drunk in order to gaze upon their nakedness.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become clogged up. The cup of the right hand of the Lord shall be turned upon you, and disgrace upon your glory.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For the violence of the Lebanon shall cover you, and the plunder of cattle shall break them, because of the blood of man and the violence of the land, a city, and all its inhabitants.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">What did a graven image avail that its maker has graven it? A molten image and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusted in it to make dumb idols?</pasuk><pasuk id="19">Woe to him who says to the wood, "Awaken!"; to the dumb stone, "Arise!" Shall it teach? Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver, and no spirit is within it.</pasuk><pasuk id="20">But the Lord is in His Holy Temple. Silence the whole earth before Him.</pasuk></chapter><chapter id="3"><pasuk id="1">A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet concerning the errors.</pasuk><pasuk id="2">O Lord, I heard a report of You; I feared, O Lord, Your deed. In the midst of the years, revive it; in the midst of the years, let it be known. In anger You shall remember to have mercy.</pasuk><pasuk id="3">God came from Teman; yea, the Holy One from Mt. Paran, with everlasting might. His glory covered the heavens and His splendor filled the earth.</pasuk><pasuk id="4">And there was a brightness like the light; they had rays from His hand, and there was His strength hidden.</pasuk><pasuk id="5">A pestilence went before Him, and sparks went out at His feet.</pasuk><pasuk id="6">He stood and meted out to the earth; He saw and caused nations to wander. And the everlasting mountains were shattered; the everlasting hills were humbled. The procedures of the world are His.</pasuk><pasuk id="7">Because of iniquity I saw the tents of Cushan; the curtains of the land of Midian quaked.</pasuk><pasuk id="8">Was the Lord angry with the rivers? Is His wrath against the rivers, or His fury against the sea? Only that You rode on Your steeds with Your chariots of salvation.</pasuk><pasuk id="9">Your bow revealed itself; The oaths to the tribes were a perpetual statement; You split the earth into rivers.</pasuk><pasuk id="10">Mountains saw You and quaked. A stream of water passed. The deep gave forth its voice. The heaven raised up its thanks.</pasuk><pasuk id="11">The sun and the moon stood in their dwellings; to the light of Your arrows they go, to the brightness of the lightning of Your spear.</pasuk><pasuk id="12">With fury You tread the earth; with wrath You trample nations.</pasuk><pasuk id="13">You went forth to rescue Your people, to rescue Your anointed. You have crushed the head of the house of the wicked, uncovering it from the foundation to the neck-forever.</pasuk><pasuk id="14">You pierced the heads of his villages with his war clubs. They storm to scatter me. Their joy was when they could devour a poor one in secret.</pasuk><pasuk id="15">You trampled in the sea with Your steeds, a heap of many waters.</pasuk><pasuk id="16">I heard, and my inward parts trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Decay entered my bones, and I quaked in my place, that [the time] I would rest is destined for a day of trouble-to bring up a people that will troop back.</pasuk><pasuk id="17">For a fig tree shall not blossom; neither is there produce on the vines. The labor of the olive tree shall fail, and the grain field shall not produce food. The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no cattle in the stalls.</pasuk><pasuk id="18">Yet, I will rejoice in the Lord; I will jubilate in the God of my salvation.</pasuk><pasuk id="19">God the Lord is my strength. He made my feet [as swift] as the hind's, and he guides me on my high places. To the conductor [to play] with my melodies!</pasuk></chapter></book>
