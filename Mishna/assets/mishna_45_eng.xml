  <chapter id="1">
    <mishna id="1">All are fit to evaluate [i.e., pledge one's own worth to the Temple fund], to be evaluated [by another's pledge], to vow [another's worth to the Temple fund] or to have their worth vowed: Priests, Levites, Israelites, women and slaves. People whose sex is unknown, or hermaphrodites, are fit to vow [on another's worth], to have their worth vowed, and to evaluate, but they are not fit to be evaluated, as only those who are definitely male or definitely female are evaluated. A deaf-mute, an insane person, and a minor are fit to have their worth vowed, and to be evaluated, but they are not fit to vow [on another's worth] or to evaluate, because they are not considered capable of intent. A baby less than a month old can be vowed, but not evaluated.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">Regarding a non-Jew - Rabbi Meir says: One can be evaluated, but cannot evaluate; Rabbi Yehudah says: One can evaluate but cannot be evaluated. Both agree, that one can vow, and have one's worth vowed.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">One at the point of death or about to be put to death cannot have one's worth vowed, nor can one be evaluated. Rabbi Chanina ben 'Akavia says: One can be evaluated because one's value is fixed, but one's worth cannot be vowed because his worth is not fixed. Rabbi Yose says: he may vow, evaluate, and consecrate [to the sanctuary], and if he caused damage, he is obliged to make restitution.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">If a woman is about to be executed, they do not wait for her until she gives birth. But if she had already sat on the birthstool, they wait for her until she gives birth. If a woman is executed, one may use her hair. If an animal has been executed, it is forbidden to make any use of it.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="2">
    <mishna id="1">There is no evaluation less than one sela, nor more than fifty selaim. How so? If one paid a sela and became rich, one need not give any [more]. But if one gave less than a sela and became rich, one must pay fifty selaim.   If one had five selaim in one's possession, Rabbi Meir says: One need not give more than one. The Sages say one must give them all. There is no evaluation less than one sela, nor more than fifty selaim. There is no re-opening for  a woman who errs [in her reckoning] of the niddah count earlier than seven, nor later than after seventeen days. No signs of leprosy are shut up for less than one week, nor for more than two weeks.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">There are never less than four full months in the year, nor did it seem right [to have] more than eight. Shtei Halechem [The two leavened loaves of wheat brought as offerings on Shavuot, which permitted using the new grain for holy offerings] were eaten, never earlier than the second day, nor later than the third day. The Lechem Hapanim [twelve, specially shaped unleavened loaves offered each Shabbat on the golden table in the Temple] was eaten never earlier than the ninth day, nor later than the eleventh day. An infant may never be circumcised earlier than the eighth, nor later than the twelfth day.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">There are never less than twenty-one [Shofar] blasts in the Temple and never more than forty-eight. There are never less than two harps, nor more than six. There are never less than two flutes, nor more than twelve. On twelve days in the year the flute was played before the altar:  At the slaughtering of [the Pesach offering for]the first Pesach, at the slaughtering of [the Pesach offering for] the second Pesach,  on the first festival day of Pesach, on the festival day of Shavuot, and on the eight days of Sukkot. And they did not play on a bronze pipe but on a reed pipe of , because its sound is sweeter. Nor was anything but a single pipe used for the finale, because it makes a pleasant finale.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">They [i.e., the Temple musicians] were [taken from] slaves of the priests - [these are]  the words of Rabbi Meir; Rabbi Yose said: they were of families from Bet Hapegarim, Bet-Zipparya and from Emmaus, places from which priests would marry [women]; Rabbi Chanina ben Antigonos said: they were Levites.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">There were never less than six inspected lambs in the chamber of lambs, enough for Shabbat and the [two] festival days of Rosh Hashanah, and their number could be increased indefinitely. There were never less than two trumpets and their number could be increased indefinitely.  There were never less than nine lyres, and their number could be increased indefinitely. But there was only one cymbal.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">There were never less than twelve Levites standing on the platform and their number could be increased indefinitely. No minor could enter the [Temple] courtyard to take part in the service except when the Levites stood up to sing. Nor did [the minors] join in the singing with harp and lyre, but with the mouth alone, to add flavor to the music. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: they did not count in the required number, nor did they stand on the platform. Rather they would stand on the ground, so that their heads were between the feet of the Levites. And they were called "the youth of the Levites".</mishna>

  <chapter id="3">
    <mishna id="1">The law of evaluation is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law of [dedicating one's] hereditary field is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law concerning a warned ox that has killed a slave is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law of the rapist and the seducer and the defamer is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law of evaluation is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. How so? Whether one has evaluated the finest-looking [person] in Israel, or the ugliest in Israel, one must pay fifty selaim.  But if one said: “Behold, that person's monetary worth is upon me,” one pays only as much as that person is worth.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">The law of [dedicating one's] hereditary field is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict. How so? Whether one dedicates a field in the sandy plain of Mahoz or in the orchards of Savaste, [to redeem it] one must give fifty shekalim of silver for [each section of field sufficient for] the sowing of a homer of barley. But if it was a field [acquired by] purchase, one must give what it is worth. Rabbi Eli'ezer says: it is all the same whether it is a hereditary field or a field [acquired by] purchase. What is the difference between the hereditary field and one [acquired by] purchase? [When redeeming] an hereditary field one must give the [added] fifth, whereas for a field [acquired by] purchase one need not give the added fifth.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">The law concerning a warned ox that has killed a slave is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict. How so? Whether it killed the fine-looking slave or an ugly slave, one must pay thirty selaim. If it killed a free man one must pay what that person is worth. If it only  wounded the person, in either case one must pay the full damage.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">The law of the rapist and seducer is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict. How so? Whether he raped or seduced a girl from among the best of the priestly stock or the humblest in Israel, he must pay fifty selaim.  But compensation for shaming and for blemish is [assessed] according to the [circumstances] of the one who shames and of the one who suffers the shame.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">The law of the defamer is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict.  How so? Whether he defamed a girl from among the best of the priestly stock or the humblest in Israel, he must pay one hundred selaim. Thus it turns out that one who speaks with one's mouth [is fined] more than one that commits an act. For thus we have also found that the judgment against our ancestors in the wilderness was sealed only because of their evil tongue, as it is written: “Yet you have tested Me these ten times, and you have not listened to My voice” (Numbers 14:22).</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="4">
    <mishna id="1">The ability to pay is according to [the means of] the one making the vow; the [determination of] age is according to the subject of the vow; the [gender for] the evaluations is according to the subject of the evaluation; the [age for] evaluations [is determined] at the time of the evaluation. "The sufficiency of means is according to [the means of] the one making the vow" -  how so? If a poor man evaluated a rich man, he pays only the valuation [according to the means] of a poor man. But if a rich man evaluated a poor man, he must pay the valuation [according to the means] of a rich man.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">But it is not so with sacrifices. If a man said: 'I take upon myself the sacrifice of this leper', and the leper was poor, he bring the sacrifice of a poor man; but if the leper was rich, he must bring the sacrifice of a rich man.  Rabbi says: I say the same applies with regard to a valuation.  Why is a poor man who evaluated a rich man obliged to pay only the valuation of a poor man? Because the rich man had not incurred any liability whatsoever. But if the rich man said: 'I evaluate myself.' and the poor man, hearing that, said: 'What this man said, I take upon myself', then he must pay the valuation of a rich man.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">But it is not so with sacrifices. Even if his father was dying [when a man vowed] and left him ten thousand, or if he had a ship on the sea and it brought to him ten thousand, the Temple has no claim at all on them.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">“The [determination of] age is according to the subject of the vow" - how so? If a child evaluated an old man, he must pay the value of an old man; but, if an old man evaluated a child he must pay the value of a child. "The [gender for] the evaluations is according to the subject of the evaluation" - how so? If a man evaluated a woman, he must pay the value of a woman; but if a woman evaluated a man, she must pay the value of a man. “The [age for] evaluations [is determined] at the time of the evaluation" - how so? If he evaluated one who was less than five years of age, and [in the meantime] he became older than five years of age, or if [he evaluated one] who was less than twenty years of age and he became twenty years old, he must pay [only] according to the age at the time of the evaluation. The thirtieth day is considered to be under this age. The fifth year or twentieth year is considered to be under this age. For it says: “And if he is from sixty years old and upward” (Leviticus 27:7), thus we learn with regard to all others from what is said about sixty years: just as the sixtieth year is considered to be under this age, so also the fifth and twentieth years are under this age. [But] is that so? Just because [the Torah] accounts the sixtieth year to be under this age, thereby being more stringent, shall we account the fifth or the twentieth year to be under this age, in order to be lenient?! Scripture says, “year,” “year” as a gezerah shavah [a technique of halachic interpretation employing an established link between identical or nearly identical words]: just as with the sixtieth year the word “year” means that it is considered under this age, so the word “year” with the fifth and with the twentieth year are considered under this age, whether [this results in] being lenient or being stringent. Rabbi Elazar says: [this rule holds true] until they are a month and a day beyond the year.</mishna>

  <chapter id="5">
    <mishna id="1">One who said, “I vow my weight,” he must give his weight, if [he said] silver, in silver; if [he said] gold, in gold. It happened with the mother of Yirmatia, who said, “I vow my daughter's weight.” She went up to Jerusalem and weighed her and then gave her weight in gold.  [If a man said, “I vow] the weight of my hand,”Rabbi Judah says: let him fill a barrel with water and put it [his hand] in up to the elbow. Then let him weigh the flesh, bones and sinews of a donkey and put it into the barrel until it is filled up again; Rabbi Yose said: “Is it possible to account exactly one kind of flesh against another kind of flesh, and one kind of bones against another kind of bones? Rather, one estimates what the hand is likely to weigh.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">[If one said,] “the worth of my hand is upon me,” they estimate his worth with his hand and [what it would be] without his hand. In this respect vows of worth are more stringent than vows of value, [while] there is an aspect of vows of value that is more stringent than vows of worth How so? If one said, “my value is upon me” and then he dies, his heirs must give it. [But if he said,] “my worth is upon me,” and then he dies, his heirs need not give anything because dead persons have no worth. [If he said,] “the value of my hand or foot is upon me,” he has said nothing; [but if he said,] “the value of my head is upon me,” he must give his whole value. This is the general rule: Anything upon which his life depends, he must give his whole value.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">[If one said:] “Half my value is upon me,” he must give half his evaluation. [But if he said,] “The value of one half of me he is upon me,” he must give his full value. [If he said] “Half of my worth is upon me,” he must give half his worth. [If he said,] “The worth of half of me is upon me,” he must give his whole worth. This is the general rule: Anything on which his life depends, he must give his whole worth.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">If he said, “the value of so-and-so is upon me,” if both the maker of the vow and the subject of the vow died, then the heirs must give it.  [If he said,] “the worth of so-and-so is upon me,” and the maker of the vow died, the heirs must give it. But if the subject of the vow died, the heirs need not give  anything because dead persons have no worth.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">[If someone said,] “this ox [shall be] an olah [offering that is entirely burnt],” or “this house [shall be] an olah,” and the ox died or the house fell down, he is not obligated to pay.  [If he said:] “this ox is upon me as an olah” or “this house is upon me as an olah” and the ox died, or the house fell down, he is obligated to pay [their worth].</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">With regard to those who made a vow of value, they take a pledge from them. With regard to those obligated to bring a chatat [offering brought to expiate sin] or asham [offering brought to alleviate guilt], they do not take a pledge. With regard to those obligated to bring an olah or a shelamim [offering whose various parts are consumed by its owners, the Kohanim and the fire on the altar], they do take a pledge. And even though he is not atoned for unless he accedes willingly [to give his obligation], as it is said: “willingly” (Leviticus 1:3), they coerce him until he says: I am willing. The same is true in the case of divorce documents: they coerce him until he says: I am willing.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="6">
    <mishna id="1">[The property] of orphans which has been evaluated [must be proclaimed for] thirty days. And [the property of] the Sanctuary which has been evaluated, [for] sixty days. They must make the proclamation in the morning and in the evening.  If a man dedicates his property to the Sanctuary and he is still liable for his wife’s ketubah:  Rabbi Eliezer says: when he divorces her he must vow that he will not derive any further benefit from her. Rabbi Joshua says: he need not do so. Similarly, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: Also if one guarantees a woman's ketubah and her husband divorces her, the husband must vow to derive no benefit from her, lest he make a conspiracy against the property of that man [the guarantor] and take his wife back again.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">A man who dedicates his possessions to the Temple fund while he is still liable for his wife's ketubah or in debt to a creditor, the wife cannot collect her ketubah from the consecrated property nor the creditor his debt.  Rather he who redeems them must redeem for the purpose of paying the wife her ketubah or the creditor his debt. If he had dedicated ninety maneh worth of property, and he owed one hundred maneh, then he [the creditor] must add one dinar more and he redeems the property for the purpose of paying the ketubah to the wife or the debt to the creditor.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">Even though they said: they take pledges from those who owe vows of value, they allow him food for thirty days, clothing for twelve months, bed and bedding, shoes and tefillin.  For himself, but not for his wife and children.  If he was a craftsman, they leave him two tools of every kind. If he was a carpenter, they leave him two axes and two saws. Rabbi Eliezer says: if he was a farmer, they leave him his yoke [of oxen]; if a donkey driver, they leave him his donkey.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">If he had many [tools] of one kind, and few of another kind, they may not say to him to sell the many and buy some of the few, but one leaves him two of the kind of which he has many and all that he has from those of which he has few. One who consecrates [all] his possessions to the Temple, they include his tefillin in the evaluation.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">Whether one consecrates his property or evaluates himself, it [the Temple] has no claim to his wife's garments or his children's garments or to the dyed clothes which he had dyed for their use or to the new sandals which he has bought for their use. Although they said: “Slaves are sold with their garments to increase their value,” because when a garment for thirty dinar is bought for him his value is increased by a maneh. And likewise with a cow, if it is held in waiting to the market-day it increases in value, and similarly a pearl, if brought to a big city increases in value. Nevertheless, the Temple fund can only claim the value of anything in its own place and at its own time.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="7">
    <mishna id="1">One may not consecrate [a field of his possession] less than two years before the Jubilee, nor redeem it less than one year after the Jubilee.  One does not reckon months to [the disadvantage of] the Temple fund, but the Temple fund does reckon months [to its own advantage]. If a man consecrated his field at a time when the law of the Jubilee is in force, he must give fifty shekel for [each section of field sufficient for] the sowing of a homer of barley.  If the field contained ravines ten handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, they are not included as part of the field. But if less than this, they are included. If he consecrated it two or three years before the Jubilee, he must give one sela and one pundion for each year.   If he says: “I shall give for each year as it comes,” they do not listen to him, rather he must give for all the years together.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">It is all the same whether the owner or anyone else [redeems the field]. What is the difference between the owner and any other man? The owner must add one fifth, whereas any other man need not add one fifth.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">If a man consecrated [his field] and then redeemed it, it does not go out of his possession in the Jubilee.  If his son redeemed it, it reverts to his father in the Jubilee. If another person, or a relative redeemed it, and he redeemed it from his hand, it goes out [to the priests].  If one of the priests redeemed it, and it was still in his possession, he cannot say: “Since it goes out to the priests in the Jubilee, and since it is now in my possession, therefore it belongs to me.” Rather, it goes out of his possession to all his fellow priests.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">If the Jubilee arrived and it was not yet redeemed then the priests enter into possession of the land and they give its value - [these are] the words of Rabbi Judah; Rabbi Shimon says: they enter [into possession] but they do not give [its value]; Rabbi Eliezer says: they neither enter [into possession] nor give [its value] - rather, it is called an abandoned field until the second Jubilee. If the second jubilee has arrived and it was not yet redeemed, it is called a ‘twice abandoned field’ until the third Jubilee. The priests never enter into possession of the field until someone else had redeemed it.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">If one bought a field from his father, and his father died and afterwards he consecrated it, it is considered a hereditary field.  If he consecrated it and afterwards his father died, then it is considered a field [acquired by] purchase - [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Shimon say: it is considered a field of possession, as it is said: “And if a field which he has, which is not his hereditary field” (Leviticus 27:22) - a field which is not capable of becoming a hereditary field, thus excluding a field which is capable of becoming a hereditary field.   A field [acquired by] purchase does not go out to the priests in the year of the Jubilee, for no man can consecrate an object not belonging to him.  Priests and Levites may consecrate [their fields] at any time and redeem at any time, both before and after the jubilee.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="8">
    <mishna id="1">If one consecrated his field at a time when the [law of the] Jubilee was no longer observed, they say to him: “You open [the bidding]!” because the owner must give an added fifth, whereas others do not give an additional fifth.  It happened that one consecrated his field because it was bad. They said to him: “You open the bidding.” He said: “I will acquire it for an issar.” Rabbi Yose said: he did not say that, but rather [he said] “for an egg,” because consecrated objects may be redeemed by either money or money's equivalent.  He [the Temple treasurer] said to him: It’s yours.  It turns out he lost an issar and the field was his again.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">If one said: “I will acquire it for ten selaim” and another, “[for] twenty”, and another “for thirty”, and another “for forty”, and another “for fifty” - if he [that bid] fifty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selaim.   If he [that bid] forty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selaim.  If he [that bid] thirty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selaim. If he that bid twenty reneged they take pledges from his property up to ten selaim.  If he that bid ten reneged they sell [the field] for what it is worth, and collect what remains from him who bid ten.  If the owner bid twenty and any other man bid twenty, then the owner comes first, because he must add one fifth.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">If one said “I will acquire it for twenty-one selaim,” then the owners must give twenty-six. [If one said] “Twenty-two,” the owners must give twenty-seven. “Twenty-three,” the owners must give twenty-eight. “Twenty-four,” the owners must give twenty-nine. “Twenty-five,” the owners must give thirty. For they need not add one fifth to what the other bids more. If one said: “I will acquire it for twenty-six,” if the owners want to give thirty-one and an extra dinar, the owner comes first. And if not, we say to the other: “It has become yours.”</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">A man may proscribe [part] of his flock or of his herd, of his Canaanite slaves or female slaves or of his hereditary field. But if he proscribed all of them, they are not considered [validly] proscribed - [these are] the words of Rabbi Elazer. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah said: just as regarding [proscribing one's property] for holy matters, one is not permitted to proscribe all of his possessions, how much more so should one be careful with his property.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">If one proscribes his son or his daughter, or his Hebrew slave or female slave, or his field [acquired by purchase], they are not considered [validly] proscribed, for one cannot proscribe something that does not belong to him. Priests and Levites cannot proscribe [their belongings] - [these are] the words of Rabbi Judah; Rabbi Shimon says: the priests cannot proscribe, because things proscribed belong to them, but Levites can proscribe, because things proscribed do not belong to them. Rabbi says: the words of Rabbi Judah seem acceptable in cases of immovable property as it is said: “For that is their perpetual possession,” (Leviticus 25:34) and the words of Rabbi Shimon seem acceptable in cases of movable property, since things proscribed do not fall to them.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">Things proscribed for [the use of] the priests cannot be redeemed but are to be given to the priests. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: things proscribed without specification fall to [the fund for] Temple repairs, as it was said: “Every proscribed thing is most holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:25). But the Sages say: things proscribed without specification go to the priests, as it is said: “As a field proscribed: its possession belongs to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21).    If so, why is it said: “Every proscribed thing is most holy to the Lord”? This teaches that it applies [also] to kodshai kodashim [sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity, they may be slaughtered only on the north-west corner of the altar, and consumed only within the Temple compound by male priests, or burnt entirely] and kodashim kalim [sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, they may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple courtyard and consumed by most anyone, anywhere in Jerusalem].</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">A man may proscribe his holy things, whether they are kodshai kodashim or kodashim kalim. If [they had been] consecrated as a vow, he must give their value, if as a freewill-offering, he must give what it is worth to him. [If he said:] “Let this ox be an olah,” one estimates how much a man would pay for the ox to offer it as an olah, which he was not obliged [to offer]. A first-born, whether unblemished or blemished, may be proscribed. How can it be redeemed? They estimate what a man would give for this first-born in order to give it to the son of his daughter or to the son of his sister.  Rabbi Ishmael says: one verse says, [All first-born males] you shall sanctify,” (Deuteronomy 15:19) and another verse says: [“The first-borns among beasts] no man shall sanctify it” (Leviticus 27:26). It is impossible to say: “You shall sanctify,” since it was said already: “No man shall sanctify,” and it is impossible to say: “No man shall sanctify,” since it is also said: “You shall sanctify”? Therefore resolve [thus]: you may sanctify it by consecrating its value [to the owner], but you may not sanctify it by consecrating it to the altar.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="9">
    <mishna id="1">If one sold his field [of possession] at the time when the Jubilee was in force, he may not redeem it for two years, as it says: “According to the number of the years of the crops he shall sell to you” (Leviticus 25:15). If there was a year of blight or mildew, or a seventh year, it is not included in the count.  If he only broke the ground [without planting] or left it fallow [for a year], that year is included in the count. Rabbi Elazar says: if he sold it to him before Rosh Hashanah, and it was still full of fruit, he enjoys three crops in two years.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">If he sold it to the first for one hundred [dinar] and the first sold it to the second for two hundred, then he need reckon only with the first, as it says, “With the man to whom he sold” (Leviticus 25:27).   If he sold it to the first for two hundred, and the first sold it to the second for one hundred, then he need reckon only with the second, as it says: “With the man” (ibid)— the man in possession of the field.  One may not sell a distant field in order to redeem a near one, or a poor field in order to redeem a good one. One may not borrow [money] in order to redeem, nor redeem it in halves. But in the case of objects consecrated, all these [things] are permitted. In this respect the laws concerning a person’s [property] are more stringent than those concerning sacred things.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">If one sold a house among the houses of a walled city, he may redeem it at once and at any time during twelve months.  This is a kind of interest, yet it is not interest. If the seller died, his son may redeem it. If the purchaser died, it may be redeemed from his son. One counts the year only from the time that he sold it, as it is said, “Before a full year has elapsed” (Leviticus 25:30). When it says a “a full” [year], an intercalated month is included. Rabbi says: he [always] gives him a year and its intercalation.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">If the [last] day of the twelve months has arrived and it was not redeemed, it becomes his permanent [possession]. This applies whether he bought it or received it as a gift, as it is said: “beyond reclaim” (Leviticus 25:30). In earlier times, he [the buyer] would hide on the last day of the twelve months, so that [the house] might become his permanent [possession]. Hillel enacted that he [the seller] could deposit his money in the [Temple] chamber and break down the door and enter, and that the other [the buyer], whenever he wanted, might come and take his money.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">Whatever is within the [city] wall is regarded as the houses in a walled city, with the exception of fields. Rabbi Meir says: even fields. A house built into the wall: Rabbi Judah says: it is not considered a house within a walled city. Rabbi Shimon says: its outer wall is regarded as its [city] wall.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">A city whose roofs [look as if] they form its wall, or one that was not encompassed by a wall in the days of Joshua ben Nun, is not considered like houses in a walled city. [A house in any of] the following counts a house in a walled city: [those in a city] of no less than three courtyards, having two houses each, which have been encompassed by a wall in the days of Yehoshua bin Nun, such as the old stronghold of Tzippori, the fort of Gush-Halav, old Yodfat, Gamla, G’dod, Hadid, Ono, Jerusalem and other similar cities.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">Houses in unwalled cities—we accord to them the advantages of houses in a walled city and the advantages given to fields: They can be redeemed at once, and at any time within the twelve months like houses [in a walled city], and they return [to the owners] in the Jubilee or [at an earlier time] by [payment of a] reduced price like fields. The following are considered houses in unwalled cities: [a city which has] two courtyards, each having two houses, even though they have been encompassed by a wall since the days of Yehoshua bin Nun, they count as houses in courtyards.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">If an Israelite inherited from his mother's father who was a Levite, he cannot redeem it according to the order prescribed here. Also if a Levite inherited from his mother's father who was an Israelite, he cannot redeem it according to the order prescribed here, as it says, “As for the houses of the cities of the Levites” (Leviticus 25:32)—[this order does not apply] unless he is a Levite and in the cities of the Levites - [these are] the words of Rabbi; The Sages say: these things apply to the cities of the Levites.  One may not turn a field into pasture land, nor pasture land into a field, nor pasture land into a city, nor a city into pasture land.  Rabbi Elazar said: When is this so? When it comes to the cities of the Levites, but when it comes to cities of Israelites one may turn a field into pasture land, pasture land into a field, pasture land into a city, but not a city into pasture land, in order that they should not destroy the cities of Israel. Priests and Levites may sell [a house] at any time and redeem it at any time, as it is said: “The Levites shall forever have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:32).</mishna>
