    <mishna id="1">Some bring Bikkurim [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the Kohen, priest] and recite [the accompanying Biblical passage], some bring but do not recite, and some do not bring. These are who do not bring: one who plants in ones's own property but [the tree] leans into [another's] private or public property, and similarly, if [the tree] leans from a private or public property into one's own property. One who plants in one's own property and there are private or public roads that are planted in the middle does not bring. Rabbi Judah says, in that case, one does bring.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">For what reason does one not bring? For it says (Exodus 23:19), "The first fruits of your land" [implying], all that is grown must be entirely from your land. Sharecroppers, renters, Sikrikonim [those who forced another to give up land at the threat of death], and thieves do not bring for the same reason, for it says, "The first fruits of your land."</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">One only brings Bikkurim from the seven species [special to the Land of Israel, listed in Deut. 8:8], [but] not from the dates of the mountains or from fruits of the valley, nor from oil-olives that are not of the highest quality. One does not bring Bikkurim before Atseret [ Shavuot, the harvest festival]. People from Har Tsevo'im brought their Bikkurim and they [the priests] did not accept [the fruits] because of the verse in the Torah, (Exodus 23:16) "And the harvest festival, the first fruits of your labor that you plant in the field."</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">These people bring, but do not recite: the convert brings but does not recite, for he is unable to say [in the Biblical recitation] "[the land] that God swore to our fathers to give to us." And if his mother was from Israel, he brings and recites. And when he prays by himself, he says [in place of, "the God of our fathers"] "the God of the fathers of Israel." And when he is in the synagogue, he says "the God of your fathers." And if his mother was from Israel, he says "the God of our fathers."</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">Rabbi Eli'ezer ben Ya'akov says, a woman who is the daughter of converts cannot marry into the Kohen class, unless her mother is an Israelite; [this ruling applies to] both converts and freed slaves, and even after ten generations [from the original convert/freed slave], until their mother is an Israelite. A trustee of an estate, an agent, a slave, a woman, a Tumtum [person of unidentifiable sex] and an Androginos [one possessing both male and female sex organs] all bring but do not recite, since they cannot say, "[the land] that You, God, have given me."</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">One who buys two trees in [the field] of a fellow, brings but does not recite. Rabbi Meir says, one brings and recites. If the spring dried or the tree was chopped, one brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah says, one brings and recites. From Atseret until Sukkot [the third pilgrimage festival in the fall], one brings and recites. From Sukkot until Hanukkah, one brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah ben Beteira says, one brings and recites.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">One who designated one's Bikkurim and [subsequently] sold one's field, brings and does not recite. And the second [one who bought the field] does not bring more from that same species. From a different species, one brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says, even from the same species one brings and recites.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">One who designated one's Bikkurim [and then] they were looted or rotted or were stolen or lost or became ritually impure, one then brings others in their place and does not recite. The second ones are not obligated in the Chomesh [the penalty of an additional fifth added to the repayment of one who accidentally ate sanctified food]. If they became ritually impure within the Temple courtyard, they are destroyed and one does not recite.</mishna>
    <mishna id="9">And from where [do we know] that one is liable for their safekeeping until one brings them to the Temple Mount? Because it says (Exodus 23:19), "The first fruits of your land you must bring to the house of the Lord Your God"; this teaches that one is liable for their safekeeping until one brings them to the Temple Mount. One who brings from one species and recites, and then returns and brings another species, does not recite.</mishna>
    <mishna id="10">These are brought and recited over: [fruit] from Shavuot until Sukkot, from the seven species, from fruit in the mountains, from dates in the valleys, from oil-olives [even from] on the other side of the Jordan River. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, we do not bring first fruits from the other side of the Jordan since it is not "the land flowing with milk and honey" [that the verse describes].</mishna>
    <mishna id="11">One who buys three trees in a fellow's property, brings and recites. Rabbi Meir says, even two [trees]. One who bought the tree and its ground brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says, even sharecroppers and renters bring and recite. </mishna>

  <chapter id="2">
    <mishna id="1">Terumah [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen, priest; pl. Kohanim, which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] and Bikkurim [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the Kohen] are subject to the [laws of the] death penalty [if a non-Kohen deliberately consumes them] and the Chomesh [the penalty of an additional fifth added to the repayment of one who accidentally ate sanctified food], and they are forbidden to non-Kohanim, and they are the property of the Kohen, and they are neutralized in one hundred and one [of non-sanctified foodstuff], and they require hand-washing [before handling] and [a Kohen who became impure and then immersed himself to become pure again may eat them only] after sunset.  All of the above is all for Terumah and Bikkurim, and not for Ma'aser [Sheni, the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there].</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">Ma'aser and Bikkurim share [laws] that are lacking in Terumah: that Ma'aser and Bikkurim must be brought to a [specific] place, require verbal recitation, and are prohibited to an Onen [a person whose close relative has died but has not yet been buried], while Rabbi Shimon permits.  They both require removal [from one's home], while Rabbi Shimon exempts.  Any amount of them [when mixed with normal food] is prohibited to eaten in Jerusalem.  Any growth that comes from them may not be eaten in Jerusalem, neither by a non-Kohen, nor an animal, while Rabbi Shimon permits.  All of the above is for Ma’aser and Bikkurim, but not for Terumah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">Terumah and Ma’aser share [laws] that are lacking in Bikkurim: that Terumah and Ma’aser's threshing-floor remains are prohibited, and they have a specified amount to be given, and they are taken from all [species of] produce, [and their laws apply] both in Temple times and in post-Temple times and they are applied to produce of sharecroppers, renters, Sikrikonim [those who forced another to give up land at the threat of death], and thieves.  All of the above is for Terumah and Ma’aser, but not for Bikkurim.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">Bikkurim has qualities that neither Terumah nor Ma’aser have: that Bikkurim may be designated while still in the ground and a person may make their entire field into Bikkurim and one is responsible for their end [i.e., bringing them to Jerusalem], and they require a sacrifice, singing, waving, and staying over the night [in Jerusalem].</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">Terumat Ma’aser [a tenth of the tithe given to a Levite which must, in turn, be given to a Kohen and which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] is similar to Bikkurim in two ways, and to Terumah in two ways.  It may be taken from pure produce to [permit] impure produce [to be eaten], and [it may be taken] from produce that is not in proximity [to the produce it is making permissible], like Bikkurim.  And it makes what is on the threshing floor forbidden [before it is separated], and it has a required amount, like Terumah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">A citron is similar to a fruit tree in three ways, and to a vegetable in one way.  It is similar to a fruit tree in that [it is obligated in] Orlah [the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, the consumption or usage of which is forbidden] and [Neta] Reva'i [the fruit of a tree in the fourth year after its planting, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there], and the Sabbatical year.  It is similar to a vegetable in one way, in that its Ma’aser time is determined by when it is picked; these are the words of Rabban Gamliel.  Rabbi Eliezer says, it is similar to a fruit tree in all ways.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">Human [lit., biped] blood is similar to animal blood with regard to the laws of agricultural impurity, and like insect blood in that one is not liable [for its consumption].</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">A Koi [animal of ambiguous status, exhibiting characteristics of wild and domesticated animals] is similar to a wild animal in some ways, and is similar to a domestic animal in other ways, and is similar to both in some ways, and is like neither in other ways.</mishna>
    <mishna id="9">How is it similar to a wild animal? [If slaughtered], its blood requires burial as that of a wild animal and it may not be slaughtered on a Festival; though if slaughtered, its blood should not be covered.  Its [prohibited] fats cause impurity as a Nevelah [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] like a wild animal, and its impurity is doubtful and a firstborn donkey cannot be redeemed through it.</mishna>
    <mishna id="10">How is it similar to a domesticated animal? Its [prohibited] fats are prohibited like that of a domesticated animal, while eating of it doesn't induce Karet [to be cut off, spiritually, from the Jewish nation]. It cannot be purchased with tithe money to be eaten in Jerusalem. [The Kohanim] are entitled to its shank, cheeks, and stomach; Rabbi Eliezer exempts this, [due to the law] that if one possesses an item, it is incumbent on the other [who desires it] to prove his claim to it.</mishna>
    <mishna id="11">How is it unlike both a wild animal and a domesticated animal?  It is forbidden as Kilayim [the product of forbidden crossbreeding or working of certain animals with one another] with a wild animal and with a domesticated animal.  If one writes that his wild animal or domesticated animal will pass to his child, he did not write over the Koi.  If one said "I am hereby a Nazirite if it is a wild animal or a domesticated animal," one becomes a Nazirite.  And in all other matters, it is similar to a wild animal and to a domesticated animal, and requires ritual slaughter like both of them, and imparts impurity as Nevelah, and [one is liable for eating] a limb from it [while it is still] alive like both of them. </mishna>

  <chapter id="3">
    <mishna id="1">How does one designate the Bikkurim [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the Kohen]? A person goes to one's field and sees a date that is bearing fruit, a bunch [of grapes] that is bearing fruit, or a pomegranate that is bearing fruit, and ties it with a string and says, "Behold these are Bikkurim." Rabbi Shimon says, even so, he reiterates and declares them Bikkurim once they have been picked from the ground.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">How do they bring the Bikkurim up [to Jerusalem]? All the cities of a Ma'amad [one of 24 regions, each of which sent in turn a delegation to the Temple to be present and represent the entire people at the public sacrifices] would go into [central] city of the Ma'amad and sleep in the streets of that city without going into the houses. When they arose, the supervisor would say, "Arise! Let us go up to Zion, to the house of the Lord our God!"</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">Those who were close would bring dates and grapes and the far ones would bring dried figs and raisins. A bull would go before them and its horns would be plated with gold and it would have a olive wreath around its head. The flute would play before them until they got close to Jerusalem. Once they got close to Jerusalem, they would send ahead of them [a messenger] and adorned their Bikkurim. The overseers and the officers and the treasurers would go out to greet them; in accordance with the stature of those coming in would they go out. All the artisans of Jerusalem would stand before them and greet them, "Our brothers from so-and-so, come in peace!"</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">The flute would continue playing before them until they arrived at the Temple Mount. Once they arrived at the Temple Mount, even Agripas the King would carry his basket on his shoulder and enter until he reached the courtyard. Once they got to the courtyard, the Levites would speak in song (Psalms 30:2), "I will extol you, O Lord, because you have raised me and not allowed my enemies to rejoice over me."</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">The young birds on the baskets would be Olot [offerings burnt entirely upon the altar] and what was in their hands, they gave to the Kohanim.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">With the basket still on one's shoulder, one would recite from "I declare today to the Lord my God" (Deuteronomy 26:3-10) until finishing the entire passage. Rabbi Judah says, until "My father was a wandering Aramean" (Deut. 26:5). Once one gets to "My father was a wandering Aramean", one takes the basket off one's shoulder and holds it by one's lip. The priest places his hand under it and waves it. He then recites from "My father was a wandering Aramean" until finishing the entire passage and rests [the basket] beside the altar and prostrates and leaves.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">In the beginning, anyone who knew how to read would read and anyone else would have it read for him. [Then,] people were reticent to bring and they declared that it would be read for those who know how to read and those who do not know.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">Wealthy people would bring their Bikkurim in baskets of silver and of gold. Poor people would bring theirs in reed baskets of woven willow stems. Both the baskets and the Bikkurim were given to the priests.</mishna>
    <mishna id="9">Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas said, one may adorn the Bikkurim [basket with species] outside of the seven species. Rabbi Akiva said, the Bikkurim may be adorned only with the seven species.</mishna>
    <mishna id="10">Rabbi Shimon says, there are three categories in Bikkurim: the Bikkurim themselves, the addition to the Bikkurim, and the adornment of the Bikkurim. The addition to the Bikkurim are from the same species. The adornment of the Bikkurim is from a different species. The addition to the Bikkurim are eaten in ritual purity, and are exempted from Demai [produce from which it is uncertain whether tithes were already taken]. The adornment of the Bikkurim are obligated in Demai [requiring the Kohen to tithe them].</mishna>
    <mishna id="11">In what case do we say that the addition to the Bikkurim is like the Bikkurim? When it comes from the Land [of Israel]. If it doesn't come from the Land [of Israel], it's not like the Bikkurim.</mishna>
    <mishna id="12">Why do we say that the Bikkurim are like the property of a Kohen? Because he can buy with them slaves, land, or an impure animal, and a creditor takes them to pay a debt, and a women takes them to pay her marriage contract, [as the Bikkurim may be used] like a Torah scroll. And Rabbi Yehudah says, they are only given to a Chaver [one who scrupulously observes tithes and purity laws], [and only] as a gift. And the Sages say they are given to those [priests] of the watch, and they divide them among themselves, as sanctified Temple items.</mishna>
