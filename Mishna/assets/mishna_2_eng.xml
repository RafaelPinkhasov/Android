  <chapter id="1">
    <mishna id="1">These are the things that have no measure: Peah [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor], Bikurim [First-fruits that must be brought to the Temple and given to the priest], the appearance-sacrifice [brought to the Temple on Pilgrimage Festivals], acts of kindness, and the study of the Torah.  These are things the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the principal remains for him in the World to Come: Honoring one's father and mother, acts of kindness, and bringing peace between a man and his fellow. But the study of Torah is equal to them all.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">One should not make the Peah less than one-sixtieth [of the entire crop]. And although they [the Sages] say that there is no definite amount given for Peah, it is all based upon the size of the field and upon the number of poor [who will be collecting it] and upon the abundance of the crop.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">One may give Peah from the beginning of the field or from its middle. Rabbi Shimon says: only if one gives the full measure at the end. Rabbi Yehudah says: if one has left even one stalk [at the end], he adjoins to it [what he has left to the beginning or middle, and it becomes Peah], if not, he has merely made it ownerless.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">They made a rule about Peah: all which is food and which is guarded and grows from the ground and collected in one crop and stored for preservation is obligated in Peah. Grain and legumes are [included] in this rule.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">And as for the trees: the sumac, the carobs, the nuts, the almonds, the grapevines, the pomegranates, the olives, and the dates are obligated in Peah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">He may give Peah at any time and it is exempt from the tithes, until he smoothes out [the pile of produce]; and he may declare his produce ownerless and it is exempt from tithes, until he smooths out [the pile of produce]; and he may feed it to livestock, other animals and to birds and it is exempt from tithes,  until he smoothes out [the pile]; and he may take it from the threshing-floor and sow it and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile] - [these are] the words of Rabbi Akiva. If a priest or a Levite bought a granary the tithes are theirs, until he smoothes out [the pile]. One who dedicates [produce for Temple use] and redeems [the dedicated produce] is obligated in tithes, until the treasurer smoothes out [the pile].</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="2">
    <mishna id="1">And these divide the Peah [corner of the field that must be given to the poor]: a river, a pond, a private road, a public road, a public path, a private path that is permanent during summer and winter days, uncultivated land, plowed land, and a different crop. One who harvests for the purpose of animal food creates a division - [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; the Sages say: He does not create a division unless he plowed.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">[Regarding] an irrigation ditch that one cannot harvest [both sides] as if [they were] one, Rabbi Yehudah says: This is a division. And all the hills that are cultivated with a hoe, even though oxen cannot cross [them] with their [plowing] equipment, he gives Peah for the whole [field, without dividing it].</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">All of these divide for seed crops and do not divide for trees, except for a fence. If there were branches that were intermingling [over the fence], this is not a division, but rather one gives Peah for everything.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">And for carob trees, all that are in sight of one another. Rabban Gamliel said: It was customary in my father’s house to give one  Peah for the olive trees on each side, and for the carob trees [to give once for] all that are in sight of one another. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says in his name: Even for the carob trees that they had in the entire city.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">If one sows his field with one species, even though he makes it into two granaries, he gives one Peah. If he sows it with two species, even though he makes them into one granary, he gives two Peot. If he sows his field with two species of wheat: if he makes them into one granary, he gives one Peah; if two granaries, two Peot.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">It happened that Rabbi Shimon of Mitzpah sowed [and came] before Rabban Gamliel, and they went up to the Chamber of Hewn Stone [meeting place of the Great Sanhedrin] and they asked.  Nachum the clerk said: I have received it from Rabbi Meyasha, who received it from [his] father, who received it from the Zugot [pairs of leading Sages from the earliest years of the Tannaitic period], who received it from the Prophets, [as a] Law of Moshe from Sinai: in [a case of] one who sows his field with two kinds of wheat - if he makes them into one granary, he gives one Peah; if two granaries, two Peot.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">If a field was harvested by non-Jews, harvested by robbers, chewed up by ants, or broken by wind pr animals, it is exempt [from Peah]. If he [the owner] harvested half and [then] robbers harvested half, it is exempt since the obligation of Peah applies only regarding standing grain.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">If robbers harvested half, and [then] he [the owner] harvested half, he gives Peah from what he harvested. If he harvested half and sells [the other] half, the buyer gives Peah for all [the field]. If he harvested half and dedicated [the other] half [for Temple use], the one who redeems it from the treasurer gives Peah for all [the field].</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="3">
    <mishna id="1">For rectangular beds of grain that are between olive trees, the school of Shammai says: [Give] Peah [corner of the field that must be given to the poor] from each and every one; the school of Hillel says: [Give] from one for all of them. They concede [however,] that if the heads of the rows are intertwined, one gives Peah from one for all of them.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">If one harvests [the ripe stalks of] his field and leaves over moist stalks, Rabbi Akiva says: One gives Peah from each and every one; the Sages say: One gives Peah from one for all of them. The Sages concede to Rabbi Akiva in [a case of] one who sows dill or mustard in three places, that he gives Peah from each and every one.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">One who uproots moist onions [to take] to the market, while leaving the dry ones for the granary, gives Peah for both separately. And thus it is for beans, and thus it is for a vineyard. One who thins out [the field] gives from the remnant for the remainder, and one who uproots from one particular area gives from the remnant for the whole.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">The [seed] onions are obligated in Peah; Rabbi Yosi exempts. For the rectangular beds of onions that are between other vegetables, Rabbi Yosi says: Peah must be taken from each and every one; the Sages say: From one for all of them.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">When brothers divide [inherited land], they give two Peot. If they become partners, they give one Peah. Two who buy a tree give one Peah. If this one buys the north and that one buys the south, this one gives Peah for his own and that one gives Peah for his own. One who sells [only] the trees in his field [and not the land] must give Peah for each and every one; Rabbi Yehudah said: When is this? In a time when the field owner did not retain any [trees], but if the field owner retained some [trees], he gives Peah for everything".</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">Rabbi Eliezer says: Land [the size of a] beit rova [the quarter measurement] is obligated in Peah; Rabbi Yehoshua says: That [amount of land] which produces two Seah [a specific unit of volume]; Rabbi Tarfon says: Six [hand-breadths] by six hand-breadths. Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah says: [The size that would be needed] in order to harvest and repeat, and the law is according to his words. Rabbi Akiva says: Any size of land is obligated in Peah, and in Bikurim [First-fruits that must be brought to the Temple and given to the priest], and a Pruzbul [legal arrangement which avoids the mandatory Sabbatical year cancellation of personal debts by deeding them to the court, and being subsequently appointed their agent for collection] may be written against it, and movable property are acquired along with it by means of money, contract, or chazakah [action taken upon a property to formalize its legal acquisition].</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">If a dying man writes his property [to another]: if he leaves some land over [for himself], his gift is a gift; if he does not leave any land over, his gift is not a gift. If he writes his property to his children, and writes some land to his wife, she has lost her marriage contract [i.e.,, its lien on those properties]; Rabbi Yosi says: If she accepts [being included with the gift-recipients], even though he did not write it to her, she has lost her marriage contract.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">If one writes his property over to his slave, he goes out a freeman. If he leaves some land over [for himself], he does not go out as a freeman. Rabbi Shimon says: He is in all cases a freeman unless he says: ‘Indeed, all my property is given to so-and-so, my slave, except for one out of a multitude that is among them [i.e., an unspecified, though tiny, portion].’</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="4">
    <mishna id="1">Peah [corner of the field that is given to the poor] is given while connected to the ground. From vines and palm trees, the  property owner goes down and distributes [them] for the poor. Rabbi Shimon says: Also for smooth nut trees. Even if ninety-nine say to distribute and one says to plunder [i.e. to leave it for the poor to snatch what they can], to this one we listen for he has spoken as is the law.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">For vines and palm trees, this is not so. Even if ninety-nine say to plunder and one says to distribute, to this one we listen for he has spoken as is the law.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">If one took  a part of the Peah and threw it on the rest, he gets no portion of it [thereby]. Even if he falls upon it or spreads his cloak on it, we remove it [the Peah] from him. And thus it is for Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor], and thus it is for the sheaf of Shikhechah [forgotten sheaves given to the poor].</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">Peah cannot be harvested with a scythe, and cannot be uprooted with a spade, so that a man will not hit his fellow.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">[There are] three "begging" [i.e., field-access] times a day: at daybreak, at midday, and in the later afternoon. Rabban Gamliel says: They only said [i.e., specified that number] so that [the begging times] should not be reduced. Rabbi Akiva says: They only said so that that [the begging times] should not be increased. The people of Beit Nameir would gather that which was on [marked by] the rope and give Peah from each and every row.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">A non-Jew who harvests his field and afterwards converts is exempt from [the obligation of giving] Leket and from Shikhechah and from Peah. Rabbi Yehudah obligates him in Shikhechah, since Shikhechah only applies at the time of bundling.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">One who dedicated standing crop [to the Temple] and redeemed it, he is obligated [to give Peah]. One who dedicated cut sheaves and redeemed them, he is obligated. [One who] dedicated standing crop and redeemed [after it became] cut sheaves, he is exempt, for at the time that it would have become obligated, it was exempt.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">Similarly, if one dedicates his fruit before Onat Ma'asrot [the point in the development of a fruit when it becomes subject to tithing], and he redeems them, they are obligated.  If [he dedicates them] after Onat Ma'asrot and he redeems them, they are obligated.  If he dedicated them before they were ripe and they ripened [while possessed] by the treasurer, and afterwards he redeemed them, they are exempt, for at the time that they would have become obligated, they were exempt.</mishna>
    <mishna id="9">He who collects Peah and says: "Behold, this is for such-and-such poor man" - Rabbi Eliezer says: He acquired it for him; the Sages say: He must give it to the first poor person that he finds. The Leket, the Shikhechah, and the Peah of a non-Jew are obligated in tithes unless he abandons them.</mishna>
    <mishna id="10">What is Leket? That which drops at the time of harvesting.  If he was harvesting, and harvested a handful or plucked a fistful, and a thorn pricked him and [the handful or fistful] falls from his hand to the earth, behold it belongs to the property owner. [If it fell] from inside his hand or from inside the scythe [blade, it belongs] to the poor. [If from] outside his hand, or the back of the scythe, it belongs to the property owner. [If it is] from the tip of the hand or the tip of the scythe, Rabbi Yishmael says: It is for the poor; Rabbi Akiva says: It is for the property owner.</mishna>
    <mishna id="11">[Produce in] ant-holes that are within the standing crop behold they belong to the property owner. [Produce in ant-holes that are] after the harvesters [have harvested that crop], the upper parts belong to the poor and the lower parts belong to the property owner. Rabbi Meir says: Everything is for the poor, since doubtful Leket is [nevertheless considered] Leket.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="5">
    <mishna id="1">A stack of grain underneath which Leket [individual stalks that fall during harvest, which must be left for the poor to glean] was not collected, everything touching the ground is for the poor. If wind scatters the sheaves, he estimates how much Leket [that field would make and gives [that amount] to the poor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He gives to the poor the amount that [normally] falls [in such a field].</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">An [unharvested] ear of grain [in an area already harvested] the tip of which can touch the standing crop - if it can be harvested with the standing crop, it belongs to the property owner; if not, it belongs to the poor. If an ear of grain that is Leket is intermixed in a stack, one ear must be tithed and given to him [the poor man]. Rabbi Eliezer said: And how does this poor person exchange for something that never came into his possession? Rather, he grants him the entire stack and tithes one ear and gives it to him [and then repossesses the stack].</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">One may not use an irrigating wheel [before the poor have collected Leket]- [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; the Sages permit it, because it is possible  [to irrigate without damaging the Leket]. </mishna>
    <mishna id="4">If a property owner was passing from one place to another place, and needs to take Leket, Shikhechah [individual sheaves, forgotten in the field, which must be left for the poor to collect], or Peah [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor] or Ma'aser Sheni [The second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there] he may take and when he returns to his house pay [for them] - [these are] the words of Rabbi Eliezer;  the Sages say: He was poor at that time.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">Someone who exchanges [his produce] with the poor [i.e. their gifts from the field], what is [now] his is exempt [in tithes] and what is [now] the poor person's is obligated [in tithes]. If two [poor people] received a field as sharecroppers, one may give the other Ma'aser Ani [a second tithe given to the poor in the the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle] from his portion, and that other may give him Ma'aser Ani from his portion. Someone who contracts for a field to harvest, is forbidden in [taking] Leket, Shikhechah, Peah, and Ma'aser Sheni. Rabbi Yehudah said: When? At a time that he contracts for a half, a third, or a fourth [of the harvest]. But if he said to him, "a third of what you harvest is yours", [then] he is permitted in [taking] Leket, Shikcha, and Peah and forbidden in Ma'aser Sheni.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">If someone sells his field, the seller is permitted [in Leket, Shikcha, and Peah] and the buyer is forbidden. A man may not hire a worker on the condition that his [the worker's] son may glean after him. One who does not allow the poor to glean, or who allows one and not another, or who helps one of them - he is stealing from the poor. Regarding this it is said, "Do not encroach upon the border of those who go up [to glean"] (Proverbs 22:28).</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">A sheaf that is forgotten by workers and not forgotten by the property owner, or that is forgotten by the property owner and not forgotten by the workers, or if the poor stood before it [thereby concealing it], or covered it with straw, indeed this is not Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">One who gathers sheaves into hat-shaped piles or cap-shaped piles or circular piles, these are not [subject to] &lt;Shikhechah; if they are taken from there to the threshing floor, they are [subject to] Shikhechah. One who gathers sheaves to a stack, they are [subject to] Shikhechah; if they are taken to the threshing floor, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah. This is the general rule: When the sheaves are gathered to a place where their work is completed, they are [subject to] Shikhechah; from there to the threshing floor, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah. [When the sheaves are gathered] to a place where their work is not completed, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah, from there to the threshing floor, they are [subject to] Shikhechah.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="6">
    <mishna id="1">Beit Shammai says: Abandoning property only to the poor is abandonment; Beit Hillel says: It is not abandonment until it has also been abandoned to the rich, like in the Sabbatical year. If all sheaves of the field are of one Kav [halachic measurement], and one sheaf is four Kav and it was forgotten, Beit Shammai says: It is not [subject to] Shikhechah [individual sheaves, forgotten in the field, which must be left for the poor to collect]; Beit Hillel says: It is [subject to] Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">The sheaf that is next to a stone wall, or to a stack, or to cattle, or to vessels, and was forgotten, Beit Shammai says: It is not Shikhechah; Beit Hillel says, "[It is] Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">[The sheaves at] the heads of rows, [or] the sheaf [in an ungathered row] adjoining [an apparently forgotten sheaf], [or] the sheaf that he took to bring to the city and [afterwards] forgot it; they [Beit Hillel] concede that these are not Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">And these are the heads of rows: two who started from the middle of the row, this one facing north and that one facing south, and they forgot [some sheaves] before them and after them, the ones that are before them are Shikhechah and the ones that are behind them are not Shikhechah. An individual who starts from the head of the row and forgets [some sheaves] before himself and after himself, that which is before him is not Shikhechah and that which is after him is Shikhechah, since it falls under [the prohibition of] "Do not return". This is the general rule, all that falls under "Do not return" is Shikhechah, and whatever does not fall under "Do not return" is not Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">Two sheaves are Shikhechah and three are not Shikhechah, two piles of olives or carobs are Shikhechah and three are not Shikhechah, two flax-stalks are Shikhechah and three are not Shikhechah, two single grapes are Peret [fallen grapes given to the poor] and three are not Peret, two ears of grain are Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor] and three are not Leket - [these are] the words of Beit Hillel; regarding all these, Beit Shammai said: Three [belong] to the poor and four to the property owner.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">If a sheaf has [a volume of] two Seah [a specific unit of volume] and he forgets it, it is not Shikhechah. If two sheaves have [together a volume of] two Seah, Rabban Gamliel says: [It belongs] to the property owner; the Sages say: [It belongs] to the poor. Rabban Gamliel said, "Does an abundance of sheaves strengthen the power of the property owner or weaken his power?" They said to him, "They strengthen his power". He said to them, "So since, at a time when there is one sheaf and it has two Se'ah and he forgot it, it is not Shikhechah, [if he had] two sheaves and they have two Se'ah, is it not the law that they will not be Shikhechah?" They said to him, "No, if you say [a law] regarding one sheaf, which is like a stack, will you say [that law] regarding two sheaves, which are like small bundles?"</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">If a standing crop has two Seah and was forgotten, it is not Shikhechah; if it does not have two Se'ah, but it is fit to make two Seah, even if it is stunted, we view it as though it were good barley.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">The standing crop saves the sheaf and the standing crop [from being considered Shikhechah]. The sheaf does not save the sheaf or the standing crop. Which standing crop saves a sheaf? Anything that is not Shikhechah, even a single stalk.</mishna>
    <mishna id="9">A Seah of uprooted grain and a Seah of grain that is not uprooted - and similarly for trees, garlic, and onions - do not combine to make two Seah, but rather they are for the poor. Rabbi Yosi says: If property of the poor man comes between them, they do not combine; if not, indeed these combine.</mishna>
    <mishna id="10">Grain that is intended for animal food or for binding [other grain into sheaves] - and similarly for large bundles of garlic or smaller bundles of garlic and onion -  these are not [subject to the law of] Shikhechah. And anything that [grows] concealed in the earth, like luf [Arum palaestinum]  garlic and onions, Rabbi Yehuda says: They are not [subject to] Shikhechah; t]the Sages say: They are [subject to] Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="11">He who harvests at night and he who makes sheaves, and also a blind person, they are [subject to] Shikhechah. And if one intended to take only the coarsest ones, it is [subject to] Shikhechah. If he said, "Indeed, I am harvesting on the condition that whatever I forget I will take," he is [subject to] Shikhechah.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="7">
    <mishna id="1">An olive tree that has a name in the field, even the olive tree of Netufah in its time, and he forgets it, it is not [subject to] Shikhechah [forgotten sheaves given to the poor]. Regarding what did they say this? Regarding [an olive tree] which is known for its name or for its produce or for its place. [What does]"For its name" [mean?]– that it was [called] Shifchuni ['The one which pours forth'] or Bayshuni ['The one which puts to shame']. "For its produce" - that it produces a great amount. "For its place" – that it stands near a wine press or near a hole [in a fence]. And for the rest of all the olive trees, if one forgets two, they are [subject to] Shikhechah, but if three, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah; Rabbi Yosi says: Olives are not [subject to] Shikhechah.</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">An olive tree that stands between three rows of two rectangles [of grain], and one forgets it, it is not [subject to] Shikhechah. An olive tree that has two Seah [a specific unit of volume] [of olives remaining] in it, and he forgets it, it is not [subject to] Shikhechah. Regarding when did they say this? When he did not start [picking] it, but if he started, even the olive tree of Netufah in its time, and he forgets it, it is [subject to] Shikhechah. Any time that [the law of Shikhechah] applies under it [the tree], it applies at the top of it; Rabbi Meir says: This is only when the olive-beater has moved on.</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">Which is Peret? That which falls at the time of the grape harvest. If one was harvesting grapes, and he was pricked by the cluster or was entangled in leaves, and [grapes] fell from his hand to the earth and were separated into single grapes, this belongs to the property owner. If one leaves a basket under the vine, at the time that he harvests grapes, he is stealing from the poor. Regarding this it is said, "Do not withdraw the border of those who go up [to glean]". (Proverbs 22:28)</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">Which is Olelet? Any [cluster] that has neither a shoulder nor a dangling portion [but rather is entirely attached to the main stem]. If there is a shoulder or a dangling portion, it belongs to the property owner; if there is a doubt, it belongs to the poor.  An Olelet that is attached to the knee [the joint between branches or the stem and the trunk] - if it is plucked with the grape cluster, indeed it belongs to the property owner; if not, indeed it belongs to the poor. A single grape - Rabbi Yehudah says: It is a cluster; the Sages say: It is an Olelet.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">One who prunes the vines may prune the ones for the poor just as he prunes his own - [these are] the words of Rabbi Yehudah; Rabbi Meir says: He is permitted regarding his own, but he is not permitted regarding those of the poor.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">Kerem Revai [the fruit of a tree in the fourth year after its planting, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there] - Beit Shammai says: It does not have a [penalty of a] fifth, and it does not have Bi'ur [requirement to remove from one’s premises, on the eve of Pesach in the fourth and seventh years of a Sabbatical cycle,  those agricultural gifts which were not given to their intended recipients]; Beit Hillel says: It has [both]. Beit Shammai says: It has [the obligations of] Peret and Olelet, and the poor redeem it themselves; Beit Hillel says: It is all for the wine press.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">If a vineyard consists entirely of Olelot, Rabbi Eliezer says: It is for the property owner; Rabbi Akiva says: It is for the poor. Rabbi Eliezer said: "When you harvest, do not take the Olelot" (Deuteronomy 24:21) - If you do not harvest, where do the Olelet come from? Rabbi Akiva said to him: "[from] your vineyard do not take Olelot (Leviticus 19:10)", [do not take it] even if it is entirely Olelot. If so, why does it say "When you harvest, do not take the Olelot"? [to teach that] the poor have no [rights] in the Olelot before the harvest".</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">One who dedicates his vineyard before the Olelot were discernible, the Olelot are not for the poor; after the Olelot were discernible, the Olelot are for the poor. Rabbi Yosi says: They give the value of the [added] growth [after dedication] to the Temple treasury. What is considered Shikcha on a trellis? Anything that he [i.e. the harvester] is unable to take by stretching back his arm. And on runners? When he moves on from it.</mishna>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="8">
    <mishna id="1">From when is everyone permitted in [taking] Leket [individual stalks that fall during harvest, which must be left for the poor to glean]? When the weakest of the poor have [come and] gone. And when for Peret [fallen grapes given to the poor] and Olelot [individual grapes which fall during the grape-harvest which must be left for the poor to collect]? From when the poor have [come and] gone and come [again]. And when for olive trees? When the second rain has come; Rabbi Yehudah said: Are there not those who do not harvest their olive trees until after the second rain? Rather, when the poor go out [to glean amongst the olives], and do not bring back [an amount of olives worth] four Issarot [specific unit of money].</mishna>
    <mishna id="2">[Poor] people [selling produce] are trusted regarding Leket,Shikcha, and Peah [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor] in their time [i.e., during the harvest], and regarding Ma'aser Ani [a second tithe given to the poor in the the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle] all year long. A Levite is trusted at all times. And we do not trust them [i.e., the poor] except regarding things that people are accustomed to [give them].</mishna>
    <mishna id="3">[Poor] people are trusted concerning wheat, but they are not trusted regarding flour and not regarding bread. [Poor] people are trusted regarding rice on the stalk, but are not trusted regarding it [the rice itself], whether raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning beans, but not trusted concerning grits, whether raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning oil, to say that it is Ma'aser Ani, but are not trusted to say that it is Nikuf [the last olives shaken down by the poor].</mishna>
    <mishna id="4">[Poor] people are trusted regarding raw vegetables but not trusted regarding cooked vegetables, unless he had a small amount, because it is common that the property owner takes it out from his stew pot.</mishna>
    <mishna id="5">One must not give less [Ma'aser Ani] to the poor from the threshing floor [than the following measures]: half a Kav [specific unit of volume] of wheat and a Kav of barley - Rabbi Meir says: half a Kav; a Kav and a half of kasha; a Kavof dried figs or a Maneh [specific unit of volume] of figs - Rabbi Akiva says: a Pras [half a Maneh]; half a Log [one fourth of a Kav] of wine - Rabbi Akiva says: a quarter; a quarter of a Log of oil - Rabbi Akiva says: An eighth [of that]. As for the rest of the produce, Abba Shmuel said: Enough that he can sell it and buy food for two meals.</mishna>
    <mishna id="6">This measure applies to priests and Levites and Israelites. If one wants to save some [e.g., for poor relatives], he may retain half and give half. If he has a small amount [less per poor person present than the amounts indicated], he places it before them, and they divide it between themselves.</mishna>
    <mishna id="7">One must not give [Tzedakah to the  poor who wander from place to place less than a loaf that is the price of a  Pundion, when  four Seah [of grain] cost a Sela. If he spends the night, one gives [bedding] supplies for the night. If he stays for Shabbat, one gives him food for three meals. One who has [enough] food for two meals must not take from the soup kitchen. [If he has enough] food for fourteen meals, he must not take from the charity box. And the charity box [funds] are collected by two people and distributed by three people.</mishna>
    <mishna id="8">One who has two hundred Zuz may not take Leket, Shikhechah, Peah or Ma'aser Ani. If he has one Dinar less than two hundred, even one thousand [people] simultaneously give him [a Dinar, he may take [them all]. If [his assets] are mortgaged to his creditor or his wife’s marriage contract, he may take. He is not obligated to sell his house or his [fine] clothes [in order to take agricultural gifts].</mishna>
    <mishna id="9">Someone who has fifty Zuz, and he uses them for business, he may not take. And anyone who does not need to take, but takes anyway, will not depart from the world until he will become dependent on others. And all who need to take, yet do not take, will not die from old age until he will [be enabled to] provide for others from his portion. Regarding this, scripture states, "Blessed is the man that relies on G-d, and G-d will be his security" (Jeremiah 17:7). [The same is true] for a judge who judges in absolute truth. And he who is neither lame, nor blind, nor crippled, yet he pretends to be one of these, he will not die of old age until he becomes like one of these, as it says, "Justice, justice shall you pursue". (Deuteronomy 16:20) And every judge who takes a bribe and subverts the law, he will not die of old age until his eyes have dimmed, as it says, "And you shall not take a bribe, because a bribe blinds those who can see and understand, etc". (Exodus 23:8)</mishna>
